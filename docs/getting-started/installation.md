# Initial Repository Setup

Quick guide to set up the complete claude-personal-assistant repository structure.

## Step 1: Create Directory Structure

Run these commands in your `claude-personal-assistant` directory:

```bash
cd ~/Development/personal/claude-personal-assistant

# Create main directories
mkdir -p docs/{architecture,user-guide,developer-guide,project-agents,examples/{personalities,workflows,integrations}}
mkdir -p templates/{knowledge,agents,memory}
mkdir -p personalities
mkdir -p project-agents/{_template,react,nextjs,golang,python,nodejs,typescript,docker}
mkdir -p workflows

# Create placeholder files
touch .gitignore
touch LICENSE
touch install.sh
touch update.sh
```

## Step 2: Add Core Documentation

Copy these files into the repository:

### Main README
Already exists - the user-facing README.md at root

### Documentation Index
```bash
# Copy docs/README.md artifact to:
# ~/Development/personal/claude-personal-assistant/docs/README.md
```

### Architecture Documentation
```bash
# Copy ARCHITECTURE.md artifact to:
# ~/Development/personal/claude-personal-assistant/docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md
```

### Development Roadmap
```bash
# Copy ROADMAP.md artifact to:
# ~/Development/personal/claude-personal-assistant/docs/developer-guide/ROADMAP.md
```

### Project Agents Overview
```bash
# Copy project-agents/README.md artifact to:
# ~/Development/personal/claude-personal-assistant/project-agents/README.md
```

### Platform Support Guide
```bash
# Copy Platform Support Guide artifact to:
# ~/Development/personal/claude-personal-assistant/docs/user-guide/platform-support.md
```

### Prerequisites & Tools Guide
```bash
# Copy Prerequisites & Recommended Tools artifact to:
# ~/Development/personal/claude-personal-assistant/docs/user-guide/prerequisites.md
```

### MCP Servers Guide
```bash
# Copy MCP Servers for AIDE artifact to:
# ~/Development/personal/claude-personal-assistant/docs/user-guide/mcp-servers.md
```

### Knowledge Sync Guide
```bash
# Copy Knowledge Sync System artifact to:
# ~/Development/personal/claude-personal-assistant/docs/user-guide/knowledge-sync.md
```

## Step 3: Create .gitignore

```bash
cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
# User-generated files (never commit)
.claude/
CLAUDE.md
*.local
*_personal.md
*.secret

# Personal configurations
config/personality.yaml
config/system.yaml

# Memory and knowledge (if testing locally)
memory/
knowledge/system.md
knowledge/procedures.md
knowledge/projects.md

# OS files
.DS_Store
*.swp
*~
.vscode/
.idea/

# Backup files
*.backup
*.bak

# Logs
*.log

# Test files
test/
*.test
EOF
```

## Step 4: Create LICENSE

```bash
cat > LICENSE << 'EOF'
MIT License

EOF
```

## Step 5: Create Placeholder Documentation Files

These will be filled in during development:

```bash
# User guide placeholders
touch docs/user-guide/{getting-started,prerequisites,mcp-servers,installation,platform-support,daily-workflows,commands,knowledge-sync,personalities,customization,obsidian-integration,dotfiles-integration,claude-configuration,troubleshooting,faq}.md

# Developer guide placeholders  
touch docs/developer-guide/{CONTRIBUTING,development-setup,adding-features,testing,code-style}.md

# Architecture docs placeholders
touch docs/architecture/{data-flow,component-details,integration-points}.md

# Project agent docs placeholders
touch docs/project-agents/{react,nextjs,golang,python,creating-agents}.md
```

## Step 6: Create Initial Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial repository structure with documentation framework"
git push origin main
```

## Step 7: Verify Structure

Check your structure matches:

```bash
tree -L 3 -I 'node_modules|.git'
```

Should show:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ architecture/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ARCHITECTURE.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ developer-guide/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ROADMAP.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ examples/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project-agents/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user-guide/
â”œâ”€â”€ install.sh (placeholder)
â”œâ”€â”€ personalities/
â”œâ”€â”€ project-agents/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agents/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ knowledge/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ memory/
â”œâ”€â”€ update.sh (placeholder)
â””â”€â”€ workflows/
```

## Next Steps

Now you're ready to start development! Follow the ROADMAP:

1. **Phase 1 - MVP**: Start with `install.sh` and basic templates
2. **Create Issues**: Use ROADMAP tasks to create GitHub issues
3. **Start Building**: Pick a task from Phase 1 and begin!

See [ROADMAP.md](docs/developer-guide/ROADMAP.md) for detailed task list.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# View roadmap
cat docs/developer-guide/ROADMAP.md

# View architecture
cat docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md

# Create first issue
# Go to GitHub > Issues > New Issue
# Use tasks from ROADMAP Phase 1

# Start development
git checkout -b feature/install-script
# ... code ...
git commit -m "Implement basic install.sh"
```
