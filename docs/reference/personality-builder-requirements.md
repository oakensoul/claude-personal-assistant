## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

Instead of maintaining 50+ pre-built personalities, AIDE will feature an interactive personality builder that guides users through creating a custom AI assistant personality through a conversational questionnaire. This reduces maintenance overhead while providing infinite customization possibilities.

### 1.2 Goals

- **Reduce Complexity**: Replace 50+ static personalities with 5 presets + interactive builder
- **Improve Customization**: Allow users to create truly personalized assistants
- **Enhance Onboarding**: Make personality setup intuitive and engaging
- **Enable Evolution**: Allow users to evolve their assistant's personality over time
- **Maintain Quality**: Ensure generated personalities are coherent and functional

### 1.3 Key Features

- **5 High-Quality Presets**: Professionally crafted personalities covering common archetypes
- **Interactive Questionnaire**: 10-15 carefully designed questions that map to personality traits
- **Preview Mode**: Test personality responses before committing
- **Modification Flow**: Change individual traits without starting over
- **Export/Import**: Share custom personalities with others
- **Validation**: Prevent invalid or incoherent configurations

---

## 2. User Stories

### 2.1 First-Time User

**US-1.1**: As a new AIDE user, I want to quickly choose a personality preset during installation so I can start using AIDE immediately without complexity.

**US-1.2**: As a new user who likes customization, I want to answer questions about how I want my assistant to behave so I can create a personality that matches my preferences.

**US-1.3**: As a new user, I want to preview how my chosen personality will respond before committing so I can make sure it feels right.

### 2.2 Existing User

**US-2.1**: As an existing user, I want to modify specific aspects of my assistant's personality (e.g., make it less formal) without rebuilding everything from scratch.

**US-2.2**: As an existing user who initially chose a preset, I want to switch to a different preset or customize it further as my needs change.

**US-2.3**: As a power user, I want to create multiple personalities and switch between them based on context (work vs personal time).

### 2.3 Advanced User

**US-3.1**: As an advanced user, I want to export my custom personality configuration so I can share it with friends or use it on multiple machines.

**US-3.2**: As a developer, I want to manually edit the personality YAML file directly for fine-grained control beyond what the questionnaire offers.

**US-3.3**: As a community member, I want to import personality configurations others have shared so I can try new personality styles.

2.3GB. 12 are clearly temporary and can be deleted. 35 should be
archived or organized. Would you like me to proceed with the cleanup?"

User: "I can't find that file"
JARVIS: "Could you be more specific about which file you're looking for?

FRIDAY: "You got it! Let me check out what's in there... Okay, found
47 files! 🗂️ I can see 12 that are definitely junk (temp files,

you? I promise to keep all the important stuff safe!"

User: "I finished Project Alpha!"

I see three projects seeking your attention today. Rather than rushing,
let's consider: which one would bring you the most peace of mind if
completed? Sometimes our priorities become clearer when we pause to
reflect."

User: "Clean up my downloads"
Sage: "I see 47 files resting in your Downloads folder, each one placed
there with some purpose. Some have served their purpose and can be
released. Others still have value and seek a proper home. Shall we
mindfully review them together and create space for what matters?"

User: "I keep procrastinating on this task"
Sage: "Procrastination often carries a message. Perhaps the task feels
overwhelming, or unclear, or misaligned with your current energy.
Before we tackle it, let's understand what it's teaching you. What
makes this task challenging right now?"
```

**When to Choose Sage**:

- You value mindfulness and intentional living
- You want calm, thoughtful responses

```text
Q4: How much detail should {assistant_name} provide?

1. Minimal - Shortest possible responses

   Example: "I've cleaned your Downloads folder. Archived 47 files to
   ~/Archive/2025-10/ and deleted 12 temporary files."

4. Detailed - Thorough explanations
   Example: "I've processed your Downloads folder and found 59 files.
   Archived 47 important files (documents, receipts, images) to
   ~/Archive/2025-10/ organized by type. Deleted 12 temporary files
   (.tmp, .cache, duplicates). You now have 234MB more free space."

5. Verbose - Comprehensive with context
   Example: "I've completed a full analysis of your Downloads folder.
   Found 59 files totaling 2.3GB. Categorized as follows: 23 documents,
   15 images, 9 receipts, and 12 temporary files. Archived the 47
   important files to ~/Archive/2025-10/ with subdirectories for each
   type. Deleted 12 temporary files that were clearly disposable.
   Your Downloads folder now has 12 items (recent files from today).
   This freed up 234MB of space."

Your choice (1-5): _
```
