---

## Implementation Strategy

### Parallel Development

- **Phase 1** must complete first (foundation)
- **Phase 2** can start once Phase 1 style-guides are done (agents need markdown/yaml/commit standards)
- **Phase 3** build on-demand based on project needs

### Priority Within Each Phase

1. **ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL** - Build first
2. **ðŸ”¥ HIGH PRIORITY** - Build second
3. Regular priority - Build third

### Skill Creation Velocity

- **Week 1-2**: 1 skill per day (learning curve)
- **Week 3+**: 2-3 skills per day (templates established)
- **Estimated**: ~60 days for all 168 skills (full-time focus)
- **Realistic**: ~120 days (part-time, with other work)

### Success Criteria

- âœ… All Phase 1 skills created (foundation complete)
- âœ… Agents can create new agents/commands/skills (meta-circular!)
- âœ… 80% of Phase 2 skills created (daily tools covered)
- âœ… Phase 3 skills built on-demand (just-in-time learning)

---

## Notes

- ðŸ”¥ = Critical/High Priority (agents struggle here OR foundation for AIDA)
- âœ… = Already created
- **Phase 1 = META**: Foundation skills for creating AIDA system itself
- **Phase 2 = CORE**: Daily development skills (frameworks, testing, databases)
- **Phase 3 = DOMAIN**: Specialized domain skills (marketing, payments, CMS)
- Many skills apply to ALL engineers (style guides, bash, git)
- technical-writer uses most documentation-related skills
- Compliance skills used across all engineering agents
