# ADR-010: Command Structure Refactoring

## Status

**Accepted** - 2025-10-16

## Context

AIDA currently has 29 commands with inconsistent naming and organization. After implementing:

- ADR-006: Analyst/Engineer Agent Pattern
- ADR-007: Product/Platform/API Engineering Model
- ADR-008: Engineers Own Testing Philosophy
- ADR-009: Skills System Architecture

We need to refactor commands to align with these architectural decisions and provide a clear, workflow-oriented command structure.

### Current Issues

1. **Inconsistent naming**: `/create-agent` vs `/start-work` vs `/open-pr`
2. **Technology-focused**: `/github-init`, `/start-work` emphasize technology over workflow
3. **Unclear grouping**: No visual grouping of related commands
4. **Missing meta-commands**: No way to list, optimize, or validate agents/skills/commands
5. **Agent naming confusion**: "claude-agent-manager" unclear scope

### Key Insights

#### 1. Developers Think in Workflows, Not Technologies

When working, developers don't think:

- ‚ùå "I need to interact with GitHub issues"
- ‚úÖ "I need to plan my work"

When managing AIDA, developers don't think:

- ‚ùå "I need the Claude agent manager"
- ‚úÖ "I need to optimize my agents"

#### 2. Granularity Builds Trust (Critical for AI Adoption)

**The fundamental challenge**: Developers won't trust "Do issue X from start to finish and commit it."

**Why command granularity matters**: We're bringing developers into agentic workflows. They need **baby steps** where they can:

- See what the AI did
- Verify each step
- Course-correct when needed
- Build confidence gradually
- Maintain control throughout

**Each command is a trust checkpoint**, not just a technical step.

### The Trust Journey

Developers move through adoption stages:

#### Stage 1: "I don't trust AI at all"

```text
/issue-create       # I'll write my own issue
/issue-publish      # I'll publish it myself
/issue-start        # OK, AI can set up my branch... I'll verify
```

‚Üí **Trust building**: AI handles low-risk setup tasks

#### Stage 2: "AI can help, but I verify everything"

```text
/issue-analyze      # AI analyzes ‚Üí I review ‚Üí iterate
/issue-implement    # AI suggests code ‚Üí I review each change
/issue-checkpoint   # I control my own commits and progress
```

‚Üí **Trust building**: AI provides value, human retains control

#### Stage 3: "I'm building confidence"

```text
/issue-pause        # AI manages context switching (low risk)
/issue-resume       # Shows me where I left off (useful!)
/issue-review       # Multiple review gates (quality, security)
```

‚Üí **Trust building**: AI handles more, but with transparency

#### Stage 4: "I trust the workflow"

```text
/issue-submit       # AI handles PR creation (I've verified everything)
/issue-complete     # Cleanup is safe to automate
```

‚Üí **Trust achieved**: Developer confidently delegates

**Key principle**: Each command is **optional**. Developers skip steps as they gain confidence, but granularity remains for those who need control.

## Decision

### 1. Workflow-Oriented Command Naming

**Principle**: Commands reflect **what you're doing** (workflow), not **what you're using** (technology).

**Issue Workflow** (work happens around issues):

```text
/issue-create       Create issue draft locally
/issue-publish      Publish to work tracker (GitHub, Jira, etc.)
/issue-start        Start work (branch, workspace)
/issue-analyze      Analyze requirements (business + technical)
/issue-implement    Implement the solution
/issue-checkpoint   Save progress (commit, log time, document)
/issue-pause        Context switch (stash changes, return to main)
/issue-resume       Resume paused issue (checkout branch, unstash)
/issue-review       Review work (quality, security, compliance)
/issue-ship-it      üö¢ Create PR and ship it!
/issue-complete     Complete and cleanup
```

**Why "issue" prefix**: The unit of work is an **issue** (technology-agnostic: GitHub, Jira, Trello, etc.)

**Why all 11 steps**: Each step is a **conversation waypoint** - natural places to pause, reflect, discuss, iterate. Not just automation.

**Why "ship-it"**: Makes shipping code FUN. You should feel excited typing `/issue-ship-it`! üö¢

### 2. Noun-Verb Naming Convention

**Pattern**: `/{noun}-{verb}` (not `/{verb}-{noun}`)

**Examples**:

- `/agent-create` (not `/create-agent`)
- `/issue-start` (not `/start-work`)
- `/pr-open` (not `/open-pr`)

**Rationale**:

- **Visual grouping**: `/agent-*`, `/issue-*`, `/skill-*`, `/pr-*`
- **Autocomplete-friendly**: Type `/agent` ‚Üí see all agent commands
- **Semantic clarity**: Clear what you're operating on

**Migration**: Support both old and new names via aliases during transition.

### 3. Semantic Prefixes for Grouping

**Principle**: Use semantic prefixes to group related commands, not nested hierarchies.

**Groups**:

- `/aida-*` - AIDA system operations (init, status, validate)
- `/agent-*` - Agent management (create, install, optimize, etc.)
- `/skill-*` - Skill management (create, install, list, etc.)
- `/command-*` - Command management (create, list, etc.)
- `/issue-*` - Issue workflow (create ‚Üí complete)
- `/pr-*` - Pull request workflow (open, cleanup)
- `/github-*` - GitHub infrastructure (init, sync, status)

**Why flat namespace**:

- Faster to type (`/issue-create` vs `/github issue create`)
- Simpler autocomplete
- Less cognitive load
- Aligns with how Claude Code slash commands work (no space parsing)

### 4. Meta-Agent Naming: "aida"

**Decision**: Rename "claude-agent-manager" to simply **"aida"**

**Purpose**: Manages AIDA itself (agents, skills, commands, configuration)

**Rationale**:

- **Simple**: Just "aida", not "aida-manager" or "aida-architect"
- **Clear scope**: If it's about AIDA itself, invoke "aida"
- **No confusion**: Developers don't think "I need the Claude agent manager", they think "I need to manage AIDA"

### 5. Modes Modify Commands, Not Define Them

**Principle**: Modes are **variations of a workflow**, not different operations.

**Correct** (modes within commands):

```text
/agent-create --global      (mode: where to create)
/agent-optimize --tokens    (mode: what to optimize)
/github-init --labels-only  (mode: how much to initialize)
```

**Incorrect** (parent/child commands):

```text
/agent create               (requires space parsing)
/agent optimize             (not how Claude Code works)
```

**Modes designed per-command** during implementation, not upfront.

### 6. Documentation Auto-Updates

**Decision**: Documentation updates are **part of all operations**, not a separate command.

When you:

- `/agent-create` ‚Üí Documentation generated
- `/agent-upgrade` ‚Üí Documentation updated
- `/agent-optimize` ‚Üí Documentation reflects changes
- `/agent-validate` ‚Üí Documentation checked

**Why**: Documentation is a byproduct of work, not a separate task.

## 7. Team Reporting and Communication Workflows

### Context: Work Documentation and Executive Communication

**Source**: Requirements extracted from "ETL and Tell" team journaling system

**Problem**: Engineering teams need to document daily work, compile team reports, and communicate technical achievements to executives in accessible language.

**Current pain points**:

- Individual daily work is lost without documentation
- Team accomplishments are hard to surface for leadership
- Technical reports don't translate well for executive consumption
- No systematic way to track time, blockers, and non-code work
- Git commits don't tell the full story (meetings, planning, troubleshooting)

### Core Requirements

#### 1. Daily Work Journaling

**Purpose**: Document daily engineering work with factual accuracy

**Requirements**:

- **Git commit analysis** - Scan multiple repositories for user commits in time range
- **Time tracking** - day_start, day_end, break_time, hours_worked (prevents double-counting)
- **Conversational interviewing** - Ask about meetings, code reviews, non-commit work
- **Multi-source integration** - Git + JIRA/work tracker + direct user input
- **Strict factual accuracy** - NEVER make up statistics, metrics, or claims
- **Structured output** - Obsidian-compatible markdown with frontmatter
- **User configuration** - Git identifiers, default hours, timezone per team member

**Data sources**:

- Git commits (local and remote, all configured repos)
- Work tracker activity (JIRA, Linear, GitHub Issues, etc.)
- Direct user input via conversational interview

**Captured information**:

- Code commits with context (what, why, not just message)
- Meetings attended (what, when, outcomes)
- Code reviews performed
- Non-commit work (planning, documentation, troubleshooting, mentoring)
- Blockers and challenges encountered
- Key accomplishments

**Output structure**:

```markdown
daily/{username}/{YYYY}/{MM}/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md

Frontmatter:
- title, date, author, type: daily
- day_start, day_end, break_time, hours_worked
- timezone, tags

Sections:
- Summary (2-3 sentences)
- Git Activity (by repository)
- Meetings
- Code Reviews
- Other Work
- Accomplishments
- Blockers & Challenges
```

#### 2. Team Reporting

**Purpose**: Compile individual entries into team-wide reports

**Weekly summaries** (personal):

- Compile individual's daily entries for the week
- Identify patterns and themes
- Highlight major accomplishments
- Document challenges overcome

**Monthly summaries** (personal):

- Roll up weekly summaries
- High-level accomplishments and projects
- Growth and learning
- Key themes

**Team reports** (compiled):

- Aggregate all team members' entries
- Executive summary of team activities
- Individual team member sections with attribution
- Team-wide patterns and collective achievements

#### 3. Executive Communication

**Purpose**: Transform technical reports into executive-friendly summaries

**Requirements**:

- **Audience-aware writing** - Different tone for executives vs technical teams
- **Business impact framing** - Focus on "so what" and business value
- **Cultural adaptation** - Match company culture (professional, startup, sports company, etc.)
- **Still factual** - No made-up metrics even in executive summaries
- **Configurable personality** - Light commentary if appropriate for culture
- **Highlight extraction** - Pull key sections for landing pages/wikis

**Tone configuration** (per company culture):

- Professional (traditional corporate)
- Engaging (startup, casual)
- Light commentary (sports companies, creative industries)
- Humor level: minimal ‚Üí moderate ‚Üí enthusiastic

**Output examples**:

```markdown
Executive Weekly:
- Opening with engaging hook
- High-level achievements (3-5 major items)
- Team momentum indicators
- Notable individual contributions
- Forward-looking statement

Executive Monthly:
- Month's theme/narrative
- Major accomplishments
- Key themes and focus areas
- Business impact
```

#### 4. Integration and Publishing

**Purpose**: Connect to external systems (work trackers, wikis, etc.)

**Requirements**:

- **MCP-based integrations** - Use Model Context Protocol for tool integration
- **Wiki publishing** - Confluence, Notion, GitBook, etc.
- **Work tracker sync** - JIRA, Linear, GitHub Issues
- **Page hierarchy management** - Maintain organized wiki structures
- **Markdown conversion** - Transform to wiki-native format
- **Automated workflows** - Publish on schedule or trigger

### Generalized Concepts

**Remove company-specific references**:

- ‚ùå "Splash Sports" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Configurable company name
- ‚ùå "sports commentary" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Configurable cultural tone
- ‚ùå "Data Engineering Squad" ‚Üí ‚úÖ Team name from config

**Make integrations pluggable**:

- Git analysis (any git repository)
- Work tracker (JIRA, Linear, GitHub, etc.)
- Wiki system (Confluence, Notion, GitBook, etc.)

**Configuration-driven**:

```yaml
team_reporting:
  company_name: "Your Company"
  team_name: "Engineering Team"
  cultural_tone: "professional"  # professional | engaging | light-commentary
  humor_level: "minimal"         # minimal | moderate | enthusiastic
  max_puns_per_summary: 2
  git_repos:
    - /path/to/repo1
    - /path/to/repo2
  work_tracker:
    type: jira  # jira | linear | github
    project_key: "PROJ"
  wiki:
    type: confluence  # confluence | notion | gitbook
    space_key: "TEAM"
```

### Proposed Command Structure

Using our workflow-oriented naming and noun-verb convention:

**Journal Workflow** (individual work documentation):

```text
/journal-daily          Create daily journal entry with git analysis
/journal-weekly         Compile week's daily entries into summary
/journal-monthly        Compile month's weekly summaries
```

**Team Report Workflow** (team-wide compilation):

```text
/team-report-weekly     Compile all team members' weekly summaries
/team-report-monthly    Compile team's monthly report
```

**Executive Summary Workflow** (leadership communication):

```text
/executive-summary-weekly   Transform team report ‚Üí executive summary
/executive-summary-monthly  Transform monthly report ‚Üí executive summary
```

**Publishing Workflow** (external integration):

```text
/wiki-publish-summary   Publish executive summary to wiki
/wiki-update-index      Update landing page with latest highlights
```

**Configuration & Setup**:

```text
/journal-configure      Set up user preferences (git identifiers, hours, timezone)
/team-configure         Set up team reporting config
```

### Agent Candidates

**Potential future agents** (to be designed):

1. **team-chronicler** - Daily/weekly work documentation
    - Uses: daily-journaling, git-commit-analysis, time-tracking skills
    - Responsibilities: Conduct interviews, analyze git activity, create structured entries
    - Tone: Factual, professional, conversational

2. **executive-communicator** - Transform technical ‚Üí business language
    - Uses: executive-summaries, technical-to-business-translation skills
    - Responsibilities: Create executive summaries, frame business impact, match cultural tone
    - Tone: Configurable (professional, engaging, light commentary)

3. **work-tracker-specialist** - Integration with JIRA/Linear/GitHub
    - Uses: mcp-atlassian, work tracker integration skills
    - Responsibilities: Sync work tracker activity, manage tickets, update wikis
    - Tone: Efficient, meticulous

**Note**: These could alternatively be modes/personalities of existing agents (tech-lead, product-manager) rather than separate agents. Design decision deferred.

### Implementation Considerations

**Phase 1: Skills Development** (foundational)

- Create skills in `~/.claude/skills/` structure
- Document patterns and best practices
- Make them available to all agents

**Phase 2: Command Design** (workflow)

- Design `/journal-*` commands
- Design `/team-report-*` commands
- Design `/executive-summary-*` commands
- Follow noun-verb convention

**Phase 3: Agent Decision** (later)

- Decide if dedicated agents needed or if existing agents can handle
- Consider: tech-lead uses team-reporting skills for status updates
- Consider: product-manager uses executive-communication skills for stakeholder updates

**Phase 4: Integration** (final)

- MCP integrations (JIRA, Confluence, etc.)
- Wiki publishing workflows
- Automated publishing pipelines

### Key Principles (from ETL and Tell)

1. **Factual Accuracy is Sacred**
    - NEVER make up statistics, metrics, or performance claims
    - All numbers must come from actual data (git, JIRA, user input)
    - If information is missing, ask the user - don't invent

2. **Time Tracking Prevents Double-Counting**
    - Use day_start/day_end to define work boundaries
    - Track break_time separately
    - hours_worked = (day_end - day_start) - break_time
    - User's stated hours are authoritative, not git commit timestamps

3. **Conversational Interviewing**
    - Ask open-ended questions to gather context
    - Probe for non-commit work (meetings, planning, troubleshooting)
    - Be thorough but respectful of user's time
    - Don't re-ask what user already provided

4. **Attribution Matters**
    - Give credit to individuals for their contributions
    - Maintain attribution through all compilation levels
    - Team reports should celebrate individual achievements

5. **Cultural Adaptation**
    - Executive summaries should match company culture
    - Configuration-driven tone (professional, engaging, light commentary)
    - Humor level configurable (some cultures appreciate it, others don't)

6. **Comprehensive Documentation**
    - Capture both code work AND non-code work
    - Include "why" context, not just "what"
    - Document blockers and challenges, not just wins
    - Provide both summaries AND detailed information

### Benefits

**For Individual Engineers**:

- Daily work is documented for future reference
- Easier performance reviews (comprehensive work log)
- Clearer communication of accomplishments
- Time tracking for billing/planning

**For Engineering Managers**:

- Team visibility without micromanagement
- Easy compilation of team reports for leadership
- Identify patterns, blockers, and bottlenecks
- Recognition and attribution of team contributions

**For Executives**:

- Technical work explained in business terms
- High-level awareness without technical details
- Team momentum and progress visibility
- Engaging summaries that respect their time

### Success Metrics

- Individual engineers create daily entries (adoption)
- Weekly team reports generated consistently
- Executive summaries published on schedule
- Leadership engagement with summaries (readership)
- Reduced time spent on status reports (efficiency)
- Team satisfaction with recognition/attribution

### References

- ETL and Tell: <https://github.com/betterpool/etl-and-tell> (internal)
- Original agents: The Journalist, The Sportscaster, The Atlassian Specialist
- Key insight: "Factual accuracy + cultural adaptation + attribution = valuable team reporting"

**Decision**: Add team reporting and executive communication workflows to AIDA command structure. Implement as skills first, then design commands, defer agent decision.

**Status**: Requirements captured, skills structure designed, command naming proposed. Implementation deferred to future milestone.

```

**Aliases for backward compatibility**:

- `/create-issue` ‚Üí `/issue-create`
- `/publish-issue` ‚Üí `/issue-publish`
- `/start-work` ‚Üí `/issue-start`
- `/expert-analysis` ‚Üí `/issue-analyze`
- `/implement` ‚Üí `/issue-implement`
- `/open-pr` ‚Üí `/issue-ship-it`
- `/cleanup-main` ‚Üí `/issue-complete`

#### Detailed Command Specifications

**`/issue-checkpoint`** - Save incremental progress

**Purpose**: Document progress, commit work, track time while staying on current branch.

**Use case**: End of day, completed a milestone, want to save work but continue later.

```text
/issue-checkpoint

# Interactive prompts:
‚Üí "What have you accomplished?"
‚Üí "Time spent since last checkpoint? (e.g., 2h, 90m)"

# Actions:
‚Üí Creates commit: "checkpoint: issue #42 - 2025-10-16

   Progress:
   Added validation logic for login flow

   Time: 2h"
‚Üí Logs time: Updates .time-tracking/YYYY-MM.md
‚Üí Updates notes: .github/issues/in-progress/issue-42/NOTES.md
‚Üí Stays on current branch (continue working)

# Confirmation:
‚úì Checkpoint saved
  Continue working or /issue-pause to switch contexts
```

**`/issue-pause [--checkpoint|--no-checkpoint]`** - Context switch to different work

**Purpose**: Stash uncommitted changes and return to main for other work.

**Use case**: Urgent bug needs fixing, need to switch to different issue, end of day cleanup.

**Default behavior** (no mode): Ask what to do

```text
/issue-pause

‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è  You have uncommitted changes:
   M src/auth/login.ts
   M tests/auth.test.ts

   Options:
   [c] Checkpoint first, then pause (commits changes, then stash remaining)
   [s] Stash without committing
   [a] Abort pause

   Choice: _
```

**With modes**:

```text
# Checkpoint first (commits work, then stashes, then returns to main)
/issue-pause --checkpoint
‚Üí Runs /issue-checkpoint
‚Üí Stashes any remaining uncommitted work
‚Üí Checkouts main
‚Üí Updates issue notes: "Paused: 2025-10-16 15:30"

# Just stash (no commit)
/issue-pause --no-checkpoint
‚Üí Stashes uncommitted work
‚Üí Checkouts main
‚Üí Updates issue notes: "Paused: 2025-10-16 15:30"
```

**Confirmation**:

```text
‚úì Issue #42 paused
  Stash: issue-42
  Resume with: /issue-resume 42
```

**`/issue-resume <issue-id>`** - Resume paused work

**Purpose**: Return to paused work with full context of where you left off.

**Use case**: Next day after pause, switching back from urgent work.

```text
/issue-resume 42

# Actions:
‚Üí Finds branch for issue-42: milestone-v0.1/feature/42-login-validation
‚Üí Checkouts branch
‚Üí Finds and unstashes work (if stashed)
‚Üí Displays progress summary

# Output:
‚úì Resumed issue #42: Implement login validation

üìä Progress Summary:
   Branch: milestone-v0.1/feature/42-login-validation
   Total time: 5.5h
   Estimated remaining: 2.5h

üìù Last checkpoints:
   [2025-10-16 15:45] Added validation logic (2h)
   [2025-10-16 13:30] Set up test structure (1.5h)
   [2025-10-16 10:00] Created branch and workspace (2h)

üîÑ Unstashed changes:
   M src/auth/login.ts (3 lines added)
   M tests/auth.test.ts (new file)

üí° Next steps (from last checkpoint):
   - Add edge case tests
   - Update documentation
   - Run security review

Continue working or run /issue-checkpoint when ready to save progress.
```

**`/issue-autopilot <issue-id>`** - Automate full workflow

**Purpose**: Fully automate the development workflow from start to shipped PR.

**Use case**: Simple, well-defined issues; experienced developers with high AI trust; batch processing multiple issues.

**Aliases**: `/issue-yolo` (same command, different personality!)

/repository-create
‚Üí Interactive prompts:
  ‚Ä¢ Repository name: user-service
  ‚Ä¢ Description: User management microservice
  ‚Ä¢ Visibility: [private/public]
  ‚Ä¢ Initialize with: [README/gitignore/license]
  ‚Ä¢ Template: [none/nodejs/python/react]

‚Üí Actions:
  ‚Ä¢ Creates local repository
  ‚Ä¢ Creates GitHub/GitLab repository
  ‚Ä¢ Sets up branch protection
  ‚Ä¢ Adds team access (if configured)
  ‚Ä¢ Runs /github-init to set up labels/milestones

# Manage access for team member
/repository-access
‚Üí Prompts:
  ‚Ä¢ Action: [add/remove/list]
  ‚Ä¢ User/Team: @johndoe
  ‚Ä¢ Permission: [read/write/admin/maintain]

‚Üí Updates VCS access

  ‚Ä¢ Make repository read-only
  ‚Ä¢ Hide from search results
  ‚Ä¢ Preserve all history

  [y/N]: _

‚Üí Archives on VCS provider
‚Üí Updates local tracking
```

### SSH Key Management Commands (6)

**SSH Key Lifecycle**:

```bash
/ssh-create-key         # Create new SSH key pair (interactive: type, bits, comment)
/ssh-add-key [service]  # Add SSH key to service (github|snowflake|gitlab|aws)
/ssh-list-keys          # List all SSH keys and their usage
/ssh-rotate-key         # Rotate SSH key (generate new, update services, delete old)
/ssh-audit-keys         # Audit SSH keys (strength, age, usage, security)
/ssh-backup-keys        # Backup SSH keys securely
```

**Key Features**:

- **Interactive workflow**: Guides through each step (no quickstart)
- **Service-specific knowledge**: Uses skills (github-ssh-keys, snowflake-ssh-keys, gitlab-ssh-keys, aws-ssh-keys)
- **Audit capabilities**: Check encryption strength, key age, last used date
- **Rotation automation**: Updates all services using the key
- **Security best practices**: Passphrases, key types (Ed25519 recommended), permissions

**Example Workflows**:

```bash
# Create new SSH key
/ssh-create-key
‚Üí Interactive prompts:
  ‚Ä¢ Purpose: [GitHub/Snowflake/GitLab/AWS/Custom]
  ‚Ä¢ Key type: [Ed25519 (recommended)/RSA 4096/ECDSA]
  ‚Ä¢ Comment: rob@work-laptop
  ‚Ä¢ Passphrase: [required for security]

‚Üí Actions:
  ‚Ä¢ Generates key pair: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_{purpose}
  ‚Ä¢ Sets correct permissions (600)
  ‚Ä¢ Adds to ssh-agent
  ‚Ä¢ Shows public key for copying

# Add key to service
/ssh-add-key github
‚Üí Uses github-ssh-keys skill for service-specific instructions
‚Üí Copies public key to clipboard
‚Üí Opens browser to GitHub SSH keys page (optional)
‚Üí Guides through verification: ssh -T git@github.com
‚Üí Documents key in ~/.ssh/key-inventory.yml

# Audit all keys
/ssh-audit-keys
‚Üí Output:
  üìã SSH Key Audit Report

  ‚úì id_ed25519_github (Ed25519, 256-bit)
    Added: 2024-10-15 (1 day ago)
    Used: 2025-10-16 09:30 (today)
    Services: GitHub
    Status: ‚úì Secure

  ‚ö†Ô∏è  id_rsa_old (RSA, 2048-bit)
    Added: 2023-05-20 (17 months ago)
    Used: 2024-08-10 (2 months ago)
    Services: GitLab
    Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Weak encryption, should rotate

  Recommendations:
  ‚Ä¢ Rotate id_rsa_old (weak encryption)
  ‚Ä¢ Consider rotating keys older than 1 year

# Rotate old key
/ssh-rotate-key id_rsa_old
‚Üí Actions:
  ‚Ä¢ Generates new key (same purpose, better encryption)
  ‚Ä¢ Identifies services using old key: GitLab
  ‚Ä¢ Updates each service with new key
  ‚Ä¢ Verifies new key works
  ‚Ä¢ Removes old key from services
  ‚Ä¢ Archives old key (doesn't delete immediately)
  ‚Ä¢ Updates key inventory

‚Üí Safety:
  ‚Ä¢ Keeps backup of old key for 30 days
  ‚Ä¢ Confirms each service updated successfully
  ‚Ä¢ Rollback option if issues detected
```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Trust and adoption**: Granularity is intentional - developers can verify each step, build confidence, and gradually delegate more to AI
2. **Workflow clarity**: Commands reflect developer mental model (what am I doing?)
3. **Visual grouping**: Semantic prefixes group related commands (`/agent-*`, `/issue-*`, `/repository-*`, `/ssh-*`)
4. **Discoverability**: Type `/issue` ‚Üí autocomplete shows full workflow
5. **Conversation waypoints**: 13-step issue workflow provides natural pause points for iteration and discussion
6. **Progress management**: `/issue-checkpoint`, `/issue-pause`, `/issue-resume` enable flexible work patterns
7. **Dopamine gamification**: Each command completion gives a small win, keeping developers motivated (vs one long command with no feedback)
8. **Full automation option**: `/issue-autopilot` or `/issue-yolo` for when you trust AI completely
9. **Personality choice**: Same command with different vibes (`/issue-autopilot` professional, `/issue-yolo` fun) - teams choose their culture
10. **Fun shipping**: `/issue-ship-it` makes deploying code feel celebratory üö¢
11. **Consistency**: Noun-verb naming across all commands
12. **Technology agnostic**: `/issue-*` works with GitHub, Jira, etc.; `/repository-*` works across VCS providers
13. **Meta-operations**: Can now create, optimize, validate AIDA components
14. **Documentation**: Auto-updated as part of all operations
15. **VCS flexibility**: `/aida-init [provider]` supports GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket with quick setup modes
16. **Repository management**: Complete lifecycle from creation to archival
17. **SSH key security**: Automated audit, rotation, and security best practices
18. **Multi-provider support**: Configuration system supports any VCS/work tracker combination

### Negative

1. **Breaking changes**: Old command names deprecated (mitigated by aliases)
2. **More commands**: 70 vs 29 (but this is a FEATURE for adoption, not a bug - granularity builds trust)
3. **Learning curve**: Users must learn new names (mitigated by clear patterns, semantic prefixes, and autocomplete)
4. **Configuration complexity**: VCS provider configuration adds setup step (mitigated by auto-detection and quick modes)

### Neutral

1. **Migration timeline**: Support aliases for 6-9 months before removal
2. **Mode design**: Defined per-command during implementation
3. **Agent "aida"**: Replaces unclear "claude-agent-manager" concept

## Notes

### Why 13 Steps in Issue Workflow?

Each step is a **conversation waypoint** or **automation option**:

**Manual Workflow (11 steps)**:

1. **Create**: Draft locally, refine before publishing
2. **Publish**: Commit to work tracker
3. **Start**: Set up development environment
4. **Analyze**: Deep requirements analysis (often iterative)
5. **Implement**: Do the work
6. **Checkpoint**: Save progress, track time (can happen multiple times)
7. **Pause**: Context switch to different work (stash changes)
8. **Resume**: Return to paused work with full context
9. **Review**: Quality gates (code, security, compliance)
10. **Ship it**: Create PR with proper metadata üö¢
11. **Complete**: Clean up after merge

**Automation Workflow (2 commands)**:

12. **Autopilot**: Automate steps 3-10 (start ‚Üí analyze ‚Üí implement ‚Üí review ‚Üí ship-it)
13. **YOLO**: Same as autopilot, with personality! üòé

This supports **both** iterative, conversational development (manual) **and** full automation (when trust is high).

### Progress Management Commands

Added three commands for flexible work patterns:

1. **`/issue-checkpoint`**: Save progress (commit, track time, document) while staying on branch
    - Use case: End of day, milestone completed, want to save work
    - Stays on branch - developer continues working

2. **`/issue-pause [--checkpoint|--no-checkpoint]`**: Context switch to different work
    - Use case: Urgent bug, switching issues, end of day cleanup
    - Stashes work, returns to main
    - Default: Asks whether to checkpoint first
    - Modes: `--checkpoint` (commit then stash), `--no-checkpoint` (just stash)

3. **`/issue-resume <issue-id>`**: Resume paused work with full context
    - Use case: Next day, switching back from urgent work
    - Shows progress summary, checkpoints, next steps
    - Unstashes work automatically

**Rationale**: Developers need flexible work patterns - not just linear "start ‚Üí finish" flows. Real work involves context switching, incremental progress, and resuming where you left off.

### The Key Architectural Principle

#### "Granularity builds trust"

The 11-step issue workflow (vs a single "do issue X" command) is **intentional product design for AI adoption**:

- Developers won't trust "AI does everything"
- They need **baby steps** where they verify each action
- Each command is an **optional checkpoint** where humans maintain control
- As trust builds, developers skip steps - but granularity remains for those who need it

**This is change management, not just technical workflow.**

### Repository Management vs GitHub Integration

**Critical distinction** between repository management and GitHub integration:

**`/repository-*` commands** (manage the repository itself):

- Create, clone, fork, archive, delete repositories
- Configure repository settings (branch protection, webhooks, secrets)
- Manage access (collaborators, teams, permissions)
- Technology-agnostic where possible (works with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

**`/github-*` commands** (manage GitHub integration for a project):

- Initialize GitHub labels, milestones, project structure
- Sync labels/milestones across repositories
- Show GitHub integration status
- Technology-specific (GitHub only)

**Example workflow**:

```bash
# Create new repository
/repository-create          # Creates repo on VCS provider

# Set up GitHub integration for project
/github-init               # Sets up labels, milestones, workflow

# Later: manage repository settings
/repository-configure      # Branch protection, webhooks, etc.
```

### SSH Key Management Philosophy

**Security-first design** for SSH key commands:

1. **No shortcuts**: Every command is interactive with security guidance
2. **Service-specific knowledge**: Uses skills (github-ssh-keys, snowflake-ssh-keys, etc.) for provider-specific instructions
3. **Audit-first**: `/ssh-audit-keys` shows security status (key strength, age, usage)
4. **Rotation automation**: `/ssh-rotate-key` safely updates all services using a key
5. **Inventory tracking**: Maintains `~/.ssh/key-inventory.yml` with key metadata

**Why 6 commands**:

- **Create**: Generate key with best practices (Ed25519, passphrase, permissions)
- **Add**: Service-specific setup (different process for GitHub vs Snowflake vs AWS)
- **List**: Quick overview of all keys and usage
- **Rotate**: Safe rotation with service updates and verification
- **Audit**: Security analysis and recommendations
- **Backup**: Secure backup procedures

**Pain point addressed**: Developers often have 5-10 SSH keys with no tracking of:

- Which services use which keys
- When keys were created
- When keys were last used
- Whether keys use secure encryption

### VCS Provider Configuration

**Design principle**: Auto-detect where possible, configure once, work everywhere.

**Auto-detection**:

```bash
# Detects from git remote origin URL
git remote -v
‚Üí github.com ‚Üí GitHub
‚Üí gitlab.com ‚Üí GitLab
‚Üí bitbucket.org ‚Üí Bitbucket
```

**Configuration hierarchy**:

1. **Project-level** (highest priority): `{PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/config.yml`
2. **User-level** (default): `~/.claude/config.yml`

**Quick setup modes**:

- `/aida-init` - Interactive (full questions)
- `/aida-init github` - Quick setup (auto-detects, minimal prompts)
- `/aida-init --minimal` - Essential config only

**Configuration separation**:

- **VCS provider**: Where code lives (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- **Work tracker**: Where issues live (can be same or different: Jira, Linear, etc.)
- **Team settings**: Default reviewers, team name
- **Integrations**: DataDog, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.

### Business Metrics Skill Category

During this discussion, identified missing **business-metrics** skill category (added to catalog):

- SaaS metrics (ARR, MRR, churn, NRR, GRR)
- Product metrics (DAU, MAU, activation, retention)
- Financial metrics (burn rate, runway, CAC, LTV)
- Engagement metrics (session duration, frequency)
- Growth metrics (viral coefficient, k-factor)
- A/B test metrics (statistical significance, sample size)
- Cohort analysis patterns

**Total**: 177 skills across 28 categories
