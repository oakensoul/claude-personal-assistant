## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-04

### Added

#### Agents & Framework
- **AIDA Product Manager Agent**: Comprehensive product management capabilities including product strategy, roadmap planning, market analysis, and stakeholder management
- **Technical Writer Agent**: Template for documentation-focused agent definitions
- **Project-Specific Development Agents**: Six specialized agents for AIDA framework development:
  - Shell Script Specialist: Bash scripting, install scripts, CLI tools
  - Shell Systems UX Designer: UX for shell interactions and prompts
  - Privacy & Security Auditor: Security review, secrets, privacy
  - Configuration Specialist: YAML configs, personalities, templates
  - Integration Specialist: Obsidian, dotfiles, MCP integration
  - QA Engineer: Testing strategies, validation, QA
- **Knowledge Base Structure**: Created knowledge folder structures for all agents with core-concepts, patterns, decisions subdirectories, and index files

#### Infrastructure & Tooling
- **Linting Infrastructure**: Pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions CI/CD for yamllint, shellcheck, markdownlint, and gitleaks
- **Secret Detection**: Integrated gitleaks for credential and secret scanning in codebase
- **Configuration Files**: Added linting rules (.yamllint, .shellcheckrc, .markdownlint.json)
- **GitHub Issue Forms**: Templates for bugs, defects, features, and questions with proper labeling
- **Pull Request Template**: Standardized PR description format
- **GitHub Issues Infrastructure**: Directory structure for issue management with README and in-progress tracking

#### Documentation
- **Linting Setup Guide**: Comprehensive documentation for installation, usage, and troubleshooting
- **Project Board Setup**: Documentation for GitHub Projects workflow, custom fields, and automation
- **Personality Builder Requirements**: Complete feature specification including user stories, schema, validation, workflow, testing, and implementation phases
- **Issue Definitions**: 30 comprehensive issue definitions organized by milestone (v0.1.0 to v1.0.0) with acceptance criteria, implementation notes, and dependency graph

### Changed
- **Project Rename**: Changed from AIDE (Agentic Intelligence & Digital Environment) to AIDA (Agentic Intelligence Digital Assistant) across all documentation
- **Installation Paths**: Updated from `~/.aide/` to `~/.aida/` throughout documentation
- **Gitignore Configuration**: Modified `.claude/` pattern to allow project-specific agents while excluding user settings
  - Excluded: `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/workflow-config.json`
  - Allowed: `.claude/agents/` for project development agents
- **Issue Creation**: Disabled blank GitHub issues (web UI uses forms only)

### Infrastructure
- **CI/CD**: All pull requests now automatically validated against linting rules
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit hooks enforce code quality before commits
- **Issue Management**: Standardized issue creation and tracking workflow
- **Time Tracking**: Added `.time-tracking/*.md` to gitignore for local time logs
- **Security**: Automated secret detection prevents credential leaks

### Project Milestones
- Total estimated effort: 350-400 hours across 6 milestones
- v0.1.0 issues (#16-#30) created in GitHub
- Foundation established for milestone-driven development
