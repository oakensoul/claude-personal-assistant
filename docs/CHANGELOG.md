## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-05

### Added

#### Installation & Testing

- **Installation Script** (`install.sh`): Complete foundational installation script with:
  - Interactive assistant name and personality selection
  - Comprehensive input validation (3-20 chars, lowercase, no spaces)
  - Directory structure creation (`~/.aida/`, `~/.claude/`)
  - Development mode support (`--dev` flag with symlinks)
  - Automatic backup of existing installations
  - Idempotent design (safe to run multiple times)
  - Full dependency validation (Bash >= 4.0, git, rsync, etc.)
  - Passes shellcheck with zero warnings

- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive cross-platform testing:
  - 4 Docker test environments (Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Debian 12, minimal)
  - Automated test runner (`.github/testing/test-install.sh`)
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow for automated testing
  - Platform-specific guides (WSL, Git Bash, Docker)
  - Test scenarios documentation with 10+ comprehensive tests
  - Test results: 11 passed, 0 failed, 5 skipped (expected)

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive testing and platform guides:
  - WSL setup and testing guide
  - Git Bash setup and testing guide
  - Test scenarios with validation checklist
  - Docker testing infrastructure README

### Changed

- **CI/CD**: Enhanced pre-commit hooks to match GitHub Actions:
  - Added `--strict` flag to yamllint (warnings now fail locally like in CI)
  - Ensures local validation exactly matches CI validation

- **Workflow Configuration**: Enhanced reviewer strategies:
  - Added 5 reviewer strategies (none, query, list, round-robin, auto)
  - Support for GitHub Copilot as reviewer (`github-copilot[bot]`)
  - Added `--reviewers` parameter to `/open-pr` for per-PR overrides
  - Created comprehensive schema documentation

### Fixed

- **YAML Linting**: Removed `---` document-start marker from docker-compose.yml
- **Pre-commit**: Fixed strict mode mismatch between local and CI validation

### Infrastructure

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Validated on macOS, Ubuntu 22.04/20.04, Debian 12, WSL2
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing on every push and PR
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit hooks with strict mode enforcement

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-04

### Added

#### Agents & Framework

- **AIDA Product Manager Agent**: Comprehensive product management capabilities including product strategy, roadmap planning, market analysis, and stakeholder management
- **Technical Writer Agent**: Template for documentation-focused agent definitions
- **Project-Specific Development Agents**: Six specialized agents for AIDA framework development:
  - Shell Script Specialist: Bash scripting, install scripts, CLI tools
  - Shell Systems UX Designer: UX for shell interactions and prompts
  - Privacy & Security Auditor: Security review, secrets, privacy
  - Configuration Specialist: YAML configs, personalities, templates
  - Integration Specialist: Obsidian, dotfiles, MCP integration
  - QA Engineer: Testing strategies, validation, QA
- **Knowledge Base Structure**: Created knowledge folder structures for all agents with core-concepts, patterns, decisions subdirectories, and index files

#### Infrastructure & Tooling

- **Linting Infrastructure**: Pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions CI/CD for yamllint, shellcheck, markdownlint, and gitleaks
- **Secret Detection**: Integrated gitleaks for credential and secret scanning in codebase
- **Configuration Files**: Added linting rules (.yamllint, .shellcheckrc, .markdownlint.json)
- **GitHub Issue Forms**: Templates for bugs, defects, features, and questions with proper labeling
- **Pull Request Template**: Standardized PR description format
- **GitHub Issues Infrastructure**: Directory structure for issue management with README and in-progress tracking

#### Documentation

- **Linting Setup Guide**: Comprehensive documentation for installation, usage, and troubleshooting
- **Project Board Setup**: Documentation for GitHub Projects workflow, custom fields, and automation
- **Personality Builder Requirements**: Complete feature specification including user stories, schema, validation, workflow, testing, and implementation phases
- **Issue Definitions**: 30 comprehensive issue definitions organized by milestone (v0.1.0 to v1.0.0) with acceptance criteria, implementation notes, and dependency graph

### Changed

- **Project Rename**: Changed from AIDE (Agentic Intelligence & Digital Environment) to AIDA (Agentic Intelligence Digital Assistant) across all documentation
- **Installation Paths**: Updated from `~/.aide/` to `~/.aida/` throughout documentation
- **Gitignore Configuration**: Modified `.claude/` pattern to allow project-specific agents while excluding user settings
  - Excluded: `.claude/settings.local.json`, `.claude/workflow-config.json`
  - Allowed: `.claude/agents/` for project development agents
- **Issue Creation**: Disabled blank GitHub issues (web UI uses forms only)

### Infrastructure

- **CI/CD**: All pull requests now automatically validated against linting rules
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit hooks enforce code quality before commits
- **Issue Management**: Standardized issue creation and tracking workflow
- **Time Tracking**: Added `.time-tracking/*.md` to gitignore for local time logs
- **Security**: Automated secret detection prevents credential leaks

### Project Milestones

- Total estimated effort: 350-400 hours across 6 milestones
- v0.1.0 issues (#16-#30) created in GitHub
- Foundation established for milestone-driven development
