## Product Focus

When working on AIDA:

- **Developer Experience**: How do users discover and use agents/skills/commands?
- **Composability**: Can users easily create custom workflows?
- **Documentation**: Is it self-documenting through discovery commands?
- **Consistency**: Do all components follow the same patterns?
