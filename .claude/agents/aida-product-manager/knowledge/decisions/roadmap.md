# AIDA Roadmap

## Overview

This document defines the product roadmap for AIDA from initial MVP (0.1.0) through first stable release (1.0.0) and beyond.

## Milestone Philosophy

**Incremental Value**: Each milestone should deliver usable value, not just features.

**Learn and Adapt**: Early milestones gather feedback to inform later ones.

**Foundation First**: Build core infrastructure before advanced features.

**Quality Over Quantity**: Better to ship fewer polished features than many half-baked ones.

## Release Strategy

### Versioning Scheme

AIDA uses semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **0.x.x** - Pre-1.0 development (breaking changes allowed)
- **1.0.0** - First stable release (breaking changes minimized)
- **1.x.x** - Post-1.0 features (backward compatible)
- **2.0.0** - Major revision (breaking changes if necessary)

### Release Cadence

- **0.1.0 - 0.6.0**: ~4-6 weeks per milestone (agile, fast iteration)
- **1.0.0**: When ready (quality over timeline)
- **Post-1.0**: Quarterly major releases (1.1, 1.2, etc.)

## Roadmap Principles

### 1. User Value First
Every milestone should deliver tangible user value, not just internal improvements.

### 2. Incremental & Iterative
Build foundation, then features, then polish. Don't try to perfect early milestones.

### 3. Feedback-Driven
Gather user feedback after each milestone and adjust roadmap accordingly.

### 4. Quality Over Speed
Better to delay a milestone than ship broken features.

### 5. Manage Scope
Be ruthless about cutting features that don't fit milestone goals.

### 6. Dependencies First
Build required infrastructure before features that depend on it.

### 7. Technical Debt Balance
Allow some technical debt in early milestones, pay it down before 1.0.

### 8. Community Involvement
Encourage and incorporate community feedback and contributions.
