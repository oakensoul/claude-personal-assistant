# AIDA Design Principles

## Overview

AIDA's design principles guide all product and technical decisions. When in doubt, refer to these principles to determine the right approach.

## Principle 1: Natural Language Interface

**Principle**: Make interaction conversational, not command-driven

### What This Means

AIDA should feel like talking to a capable assistant, not typing commands into a terminal. Users express intent naturally, and AIDA figures out how to help.

### Examples

**Good (Natural Language)**:

- "Help me start my day"
- "What should I focus on today?"
- "Remember that I prefer TypeScript for new projects"
- "Show me what I was working on yesterday"
- "Switch to my work personality"

**Bad (Command-Driven)**:

- `aida morning-routine --execute`
- `aida tasks --priority high --list`
- `aida config set preferred_language typescript`
- `aida memory query --date yesterday --type work`
- `aida personality set --name work`

### Design Implications

- Commands should accept natural language input, not just flags
- AIDA should infer intent from context when possible
- Help text should explain capabilities, not just syntax
- Error messages should be conversational, not technical
- CLI should support both explicit commands and conversational mode

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Lower learning curve for new users
- More flexible and forgiving interface
- Feels more like AI assistant, less like tool
- Aligns with AIDA's "conversational OS" vision

**Cons**:

- Harder to script/automate (though still possible)
- Ambiguity in parsing intent
- May be slower for power users who know exact commands

**Resolution**: Provide both modes - conversational for exploration, explicit commands for automation/scripting.

### Validation

This principle is working when:

- New users can accomplish tasks without reading documentation
- Users prefer conversational interaction over command flags
- Onboarding friction is low
- Users describe AIDA as "natural" or "intuitive"

## Principle 2: Persistence Across Sessions

**Principle**: Maintain memory and context between conversations

### What This Means

AIDA remembers previous conversations, decisions, preferences, and context. Each interaction builds on past interactions rather than starting fresh.

### Examples

**Good (Persistent Context)**:

- "Continue working on that API design we discussed yesterday"
- "Use the same approach you suggested last time"
- "What projects am I currently working on?"
- "Why did we decide to use PostgreSQL over MongoDB?" (recalls past decision)

**Bad (Stateless)**:

- Requiring user to re-explain project context each session
- Forgetting previous decisions and suggesting same thing again
- Not knowing what user was working on recently
- Asking user to provide information AIDA already knows

### Design Implications

- Memory system is core infrastructure, not optional feature
- Every significant interaction should be stored (decisions, preferences, context)
- Memory should be queryable and transparent (users can see what's remembered)
- Memory should degrade gracefully (old context less influential than recent)
- Clear separation: short-term (session), medium-term (project), long-term (user preferences)

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Users feel AIDA "knows them"
- No repeating context each session
- Decisions and preferences persist
- AI gets better at helping over time

**Cons**:

- Memory storage and retrieval complexity
- Privacy concerns (what's being remembered?)
- Potential for stale or incorrect memory
- Performance impact of large memory systems

**Resolution**:

- Make memory transparent (users can view/edit)
- Provide memory controls (delete, categorize, export)
- Implement memory decay (old context fades)
- Performance: index and cache frequently accessed memory

### Validation

This principle is working when:

- Users reference past conversations without re-explaining
- AIDA proactively uses context from previous sessions
- Users trust memory system (feel it's accurate)
- Returning users have faster, better interactions than new users

## Principle 3: Modularity & Extensibility

**Principle**: Enable customization through pluggable personalities and agents

### What This Means

AIDA should be composable - users can customize personalities, add agents, and extend functionality without modifying core code.

### Examples

**Good (Modular)**:

- Switch between JARVIS (professional) and Drill Sergeant (motivational)
- Add custom "kubernetes-expert" agent for k8s help
- Community-contributed agents can be installed via config
- Personality configurations can be exported/imported/shared
- Plugin system for extending AIDA (future)

**Bad (Monolithic)**:

- Hardcoded personality in core code
- Adding agent requires forking AIDA repo
- No way to customize behavior without code changes
- Can't share configurations with others
- Extensions require rebuilding AIDA

### Design Implications

- Personality system: YAML-based, hot-swappable
- Agent architecture: Pluggable, isolated, well-defined interfaces
- Configuration: External to code, easy to share
- Extension points: Clear APIs for adding functionality
- Community: Enable sharing of personalities, agents, workflows

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Users can customize AIDA to fit needs
- Community can contribute agents/personalities
- No vendor lock-in to specific behaviors
- AIDA can evolve with user needs
- Shareability increases adoption

**Cons**:

- Complexity in architecture (plugin systems are hard)
- Quality control for community contributions
- Testing burden (many configurations to test)
- Documentation overhead (each extension needs docs)

**Resolution**:

- Start with simple plugin model (YAML configs)
- Curate official personalities/agents
- Community marketplace (future) with ratings/reviews
- Clear extension guidelines and templates

### Validation

This principle is working when:

- Users customize AIDA beyond defaults
- Community contributions emerge (shared personalities/agents)
- Users don't need to fork AIDA to customize
- New agents/personalities can be added without core changes

## Principle 4: Privacy-Aware Architecture

**Principle**: Separate public framework from private configurations

### What This Means

AIDA framework is public and shareable, but user data and configurations remain private. Users control what data AIDA sees and how it's used.

### Examples

**Good (Privacy-Aware)**:

- Framework code in public repo (claude-personal-assistant)
- User config in private directory (~/.claude/)
- Secrets in separate private repo (dotfiles-private)
- Knowledge sync scrubs private data before sharing
- Clear indicators: what's local vs what goes to Claude API
- User control over data retention and deletion

**Bad (Privacy-Ignorant)**:

- Mixing user data with framework code
- No separation between public and private
- Unclear what data is sent to cloud
- No way to audit or control data flow
- Secrets in version-controlled configs

### Design Implications

- Three-repo architecture: framework, dotfiles (public templates), dotfiles-private
- Clear boundaries: framework code vs user data vs secrets
- Transparency: users know what data is stored where
- Controls: users can view, edit, delete any stored data
- Scrubbing: automated privacy filtering for knowledge sync
- Local-first: minimize cloud dependencies

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Users trust AIDA with sensitive data
- Can work on proprietary code without concerns
- Framework can be open-source while keeping user data private
- Compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, etc.)
- Users control their data

**Cons**:

- Architectural complexity (managing separation)
- Setup complexity (multiple repos/directories)
- Harder to provide cloud features (sync, backup)
- Users responsible for data management

**Resolution**:

- Clear documentation on architecture
- Install script handles setup automatically
- Optional cloud features (opt-in)
- Make privacy boundaries visible and understandable

### Validation

This principle is working when:

- Users trust AIDA with proprietary/sensitive work
- Privacy-conscious orgs adopt AIDA
- Users understand what data is stored where
- No accidental exposure of private data
- Framework repo has no user-specific data

## Principle 5: Platform-Focused Development

**Principle**: Deliver excellent experience on target platforms (macOS first, Linux second)

### What This Means

AIDA prioritizes macOS as primary platform (where most development happens) with Linux support planned. Windows is not a priority for initial releases. Better to excel on 2 platforms than be mediocre on 3.

### Examples

**Good (Platform-Focused)**:

- macOS-first installation (uses Homebrew, assumes zsh/bash)
- Leverage macOS features (Spotlight integration future)
- Test primarily on macOS, ensure Linux compatibility
- Clear platform requirements in docs
- Platform-specific optimizations where beneficial

**Bad (Platform-Agnostic Compromise)**:

- Lowest-common-denominator features across all OSes
- Windows quirks holding back macOS/Linux features
- Generic installation that works poorly everywhere
- No platform-specific polish or optimization
- Trying to support platforms with insufficient testing

### Design Implications

- Install scripts: macOS primary, Linux secondary, Windows out-of-scope for 1.0
- Shell scripts: assume bash/zsh (not cmd.exe or PowerShell)
- File paths: Unix conventions (forward slashes, ~/.config, etc.)
- Dependencies: Can use macOS/Linux tools without Windows equivalents
- Testing: macOS required, Linux best-effort, Windows not tested

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Higher quality on supported platforms
- Faster development (not solving Windows quirks)
- Can leverage platform-specific features
- Clear scope reduces testing burden
- 90% of target users on macOS/Linux anyway

**Cons**:

- Windows users excluded (until post-1.0)
- Some potential users turned away
- Community contributions may require Windows support
- Documentation must be clear about platform support

**Resolution**:

- Be transparent about platform support
- Welcome community contributions for Windows (post-1.0)
- Focus on excellence on supported platforms
- Roadmap for Windows support (post-1.0, community-driven)

### Validation

This principle is working when:

- macOS installation is smooth and error-free
- Linux users report good compatibility
- No Windows-specific bugs blocking macOS/Linux users
- Platform-specific features enhance experience
- Windows users understand status and timeline

## Applying Design Principles

### In Product Decisions

When evaluating a feature request:

1. Does this align with natural language principle? (conversational?)
2. How does this interact with memory/persistence? (stateful?)
3. Can this be modular/extensible? (pluggable?)
4. What are privacy implications? (data boundaries?)
5. Does this work on macOS/Linux? (platform support?)

### In Technical Decisions

When evaluating technical approach:

1. Natural language: Does this make interaction more conversational?
2. Persistence: How does this integrate with memory system?
3. Modularity: Is this extensible without core changes?
4. Privacy: Clear separation of user data?
5. Platform: Works well on macOS/Linux?

### Resolving Conflicts

When principles conflict, prioritize:

1. **Privacy** (non-negotiable - user data security)
2. **Persistence** (core differentiator - memory is key)
3. **Natural language** (user experience - conversational is vision)
4. **Modularity** (long-term value - enables growth)
5. **Platform** (practical constraint - focus over breadth)

## Evolution of Principles

These principles should be reviewed and refined:

- After each major milestone (0.1.0, 0.2.0, etc.)
- When significant user feedback challenges assumptions
- When technical constraints change (new platforms, new AI capabilities)
- Annually for strategic alignment

Principles can evolve, but changes should be:

- Deliberate and documented
- Based on evidence (user feedback, data)
- Communicated clearly to community
- Reflected in updated roadmap and features

## Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

### Anti-Pattern 1: Feature Bloat

Adding features that violate principles just because competitors have them

**Example**: Adding Windows support in 0.1.0 just because ChatGPT runs on Windows
**Why Bad**: Violates platform-focus principle, dilutes quality on primary platforms
**Better Approach**: Deliver excellent macOS/Linux experience, defer Windows to post-1.0

### Anti-Pattern 2: Stateless Convenience

Making AIDA stateless to simplify implementation

**Example**: Not persisting conversation history to avoid database complexity
**Why Bad**: Violates persistence principle, loses core differentiator
**Better Approach**: Invest in robust memory system, it's AIDA's superpower

### Anti-Pattern 3: Monolithic Rigidity

Hardcoding behaviors to avoid plugin architecture complexity

**Example**: Hardcoding JARVIS personality instead of YAML-based system
**Why Bad**: Violates modularity principle, prevents customization
**Better Approach**: Invest in plugin architecture, enables community growth

### Anti-Pattern 4: Privacy Compromise

Mixing user data with framework code for convenience

**Example**: Storing user configs in git repo with framework code
**Why Bad**: Violates privacy principle, prevents open-source sharing
**Better Approach**: Maintain clear separation, even if more complex

### Anti-Pattern 5: Command-Line Obsession

Forcing CLI paradigms when conversation is more natural

**Example**: Requiring `aida task add --title "Fix bug" --priority high`
**Why Bad**: Violates natural language principle, feels like tool not assistant
**Better Approach**: Support natural "Remember to fix that bug, it's high priority"

## Success Metrics

Design principles are being followed when:

- New features align with all 5 principles (or conflicts are explicitly resolved)
- User feedback references principles positively ("love the privacy focus", "feels natural")
- Technical decisions reference principles in documentation
- Community contributions align with principles
- No major compromises to principles without team consensus
