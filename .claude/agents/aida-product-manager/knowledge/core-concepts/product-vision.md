# AIDA Product Vision

## Purpose

AIDA (Agentic Intelligence Digital Assistant) is a conversational, agentic operating system for managing digital life through Claude AI. AIDA transforms how users interact with AI assistance by making it personal, persistent, and adaptable to individual needs.

## Vision Statement

**AIDA makes AI assistance feel like your own personal assistant - one that knows your preferences, remembers your context, and adapts to your communication style.**

Unlike generic AI chatbots that treat every conversation as new, AIDA provides:
- Continuity across sessions (memory and context)
- Personalized interaction (customizable personalities)
- Privacy-first architecture (your data stays yours)
- Modular extensibility (agents for specialized tasks)

## Mission

**To create an AI assistant framework that empowers users to customize, extend, and truly own their AI experience while maintaining privacy and control.**

AIDA is not just another AI wrapper - it's a framework for building your ideal AI assistant that grows and evolves with you.

## Core Goals

### 1. Natural Language Interface
**Goal**: Make interaction conversational, not command-driven

AIDA should feel like talking to a capable assistant, not typing commands into a terminal. Users express intent naturally, and AIDA figures out how to help.

**Examples**:
- "Help me start my day" (not `aida morning-routine --execute`)
- "What should I focus on today?" (not `aida tasks --priority high --list`)
- "Remember that I prefer TypeScript for new projects" (not `aida config set preferred_language typescript`)

**Success Criteria**:
- Users prefer conversational interaction over command flags
- New users can be productive without reading documentation
- AIDA infers intent from context, not explicit commands

### 2. Persistence Across Sessions
**Goal**: Maintain memory and context between conversations

AIDA remembers previous conversations, decisions, preferences, and context. Each interaction builds on past interactions rather than starting fresh.

**Examples**:
- "Continue working on that API design we discussed yesterday"
- "Use the same approach you suggested last time for this task"
- "What projects am I currently working on?"

**Success Criteria**:
- Users feel AIDA "knows them" and their work
- Context from previous sessions informs current responses
- Decision history is accessible and queryable
- Memory system is transparent (users understand what's remembered)

### 3. Modularity & Extensibility
**Goal**: Enable customization through pluggable personalities and agents

AIDA should be composable - users can customize personalities, add agents, and extend functionality without modifying core code.

**Examples**:
- Switch between JARVIS (professional) and Drill Sergeant (motivational) personalities
- Add custom agents for specific domains (e.g., "kubernetes-expert" agent)
- Share personality configurations with team members
- Extend AIDA with community-built plugins (future)

**Success Criteria**:
- Users can customize AIDA to fit their needs
- Personality system is flexible and extensible
- Agents can be added/removed without system changes
- Community contributions are possible and encouraged

### 4. Privacy-Aware Architecture
**Goal**: Separate public framework from private configurations

AIDA framework is public and shareable, but user data and configurations remain private. Users control what data AIDA sees and how it's used.

**Examples**:
- Framework code in public repo (claude-personal-assistant)
- User configurations in private directory (~/.claude/)
- Secrets and sensitive data in separate private repo (dotfiles-private)
- Knowledge sync system scrubs private data before sharing

**Success Criteria**:
- Users can share AIDA framework without exposing personal data
- Clear separation between public and private data
- Users understand what data is stored and where
- Privacy controls are transparent and accessible

### 5. Platform-Focused Development
**Goal**: Deliver excellent experience on target platforms

AIDA focuses on macOS as primary platform (where most development happens) with Linux support planned. Windows is not a priority for initial releases.

**Examples**:
- macOS-first installation and setup
- Leverage macOS-specific features (Spotlight integration future)
- Linux compatibility for server/cloud environments
- Windows support deferred to post-1.0.0

**Success Criteria**:
- Seamless installation and setup on macOS
- All features work reliably on macOS
- Linux support for core features by 1.0.0
- No Windows-specific bugs blocking macOS/Linux users

## Success Criteria

AIDA is successful when:

### User Experience
- Users feel AIDA is "their" assistant (personal, not generic)
- Users trust AIDA to remember context and preferences
- Users prefer AIDA over switching between multiple AI tools
- Users customize AIDA to fit their workflow
- Users recommend AIDA to colleagues and friends

### Technical Excellence
- Installation is smooth and error-free
- System is stable and reliable across sessions
- Memory system maintains accurate context
- Privacy boundaries are clear and enforced
- Performance is responsive (no noticeable lag)

### Community & Growth
- Users contribute custom personalities and agents
- Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- Issues are reported and addressed quickly
- Community forms around AIDA (discussions, sharing)
- Framework is forked and extended by others

### Product Metrics
- 0.1.0 MVP is usable for daily workflows
- 1.0.0 is production-ready for professional use
- Users stick with AIDA beyond initial trial
- Positive feedback on personality system
- Low barrier to customization and extension

## Non-Goals (What AIDA Is Not)

To maintain focus, AIDA explicitly **does not** aim to:

### Not a Chat Interface
AIDA is not building a web UI or mobile app for chatting with Claude. Those exist already. AIDA is a CLI-first framework focused on system integration and workflow automation.

### Not a Copilot Clone
AIDA is not focused solely on code generation. GitHub Copilot excels at code completion. AIDA's scope is broader - managing digital life, not just writing code.

### Not a Team Collaboration Tool
AIDA focuses on individual productivity, not team collaboration. Multi-user features, shared workspaces, and team dashboards are out of scope for 1.0.0.

### Not a Cloud Service
AIDA is local-first. We're not building cloud sync, hosted dashboards, or SaaS offerings. User data stays on user machines.

### Not Platform-Agnostic
AIDA prioritizes macOS and Linux, not Windows. Supporting all platforms would slow development and compromise quality on primary platforms.

## Evolution Over Time

AIDA's vision will evolve based on:
- **User feedback** - What users actually need vs what we think they need
- **Technical learnings** - What's feasible vs what's theoretical
- **Community input** - What contributors want to build
- **Market changes** - How AI landscape evolves (Claude capabilities, competitors)

The vision should be reviewed and updated:
- After each major milestone (0.1.0, 0.2.0, etc.)
- When significant user feedback emerges
- When technical constraints change (new Claude features, platform changes)
- Annually for strategic alignment
