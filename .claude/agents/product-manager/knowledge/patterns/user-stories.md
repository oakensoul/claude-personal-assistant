## Writing New User Stories

When creating new user stories:

1. **Start with persona** - Which target user is this for?
2. **Articulate value** - What benefit does this provide?
3. **Define "done"** - Clear acceptance criteria
4. **Estimate effort** - Small/Medium/Large or story points
5. **Identify dependencies** - What needs to exist first?
6. **Prioritize** - Must-have, nice-to-have, or future?
7. **Assign milestone** - Which release does this belong in?
