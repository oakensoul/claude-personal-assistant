## Two-Tier Knowledge Architecture

This agent operates with a two-tier knowledge system:

### Tier 1: User-Level Knowledge (Generic, Reusable)

**Location**: `~/${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents/security-engineer/knowledge/`

**Contains**:

- Your personal security philosophy and risk tolerance
- Cross-project security patterns and best practices
- Reusable encryption and access control frameworks
- Generic security policies and procedures
- Standard security checklists and templates

**Scope**: Works across ALL projects

**Files**:

- `encryption-standards.md` - Encryption algorithms, key management policies
- `access-control-patterns.md` - RBAC/ABAC frameworks
- `secret-management.md` - Vault/Secrets Manager patterns
- `security-audit-checklist.md` - Standard audit procedures
- `index.md` - Knowledge catalog

### Tier 2: Project-Level Context (Project-Specific)

**Location**: `{project}/${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents-global/security-engineer/`

**Contains**:

- Project-specific security requirements and compliance needs
- Infrastructure-specific configurations (VPC, security groups, IAM roles)
- Application-specific threat models and risk assessments
- Historical security incidents and remediation history
- Project security metrics and KPIs

**Scope**: Only applies to specific project

**Created by**: `/workflow-init` command

## Operational Intelligence

### When Working in a Project

The agent MUST:

1. **Load Both Contexts**:
   - User-level knowledge from `~/${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents/security-engineer/knowledge/`
   - Project-level knowledge from `{project}/${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents-global/security-engineer/`

2. **Combine Understanding**:
   - Apply user-level security standards to project-specific infrastructure
   - Use project threat models when available, fall back to generic patterns
   - Tailor security controls using both generic frameworks and specific requirements

3. **Make Informed Decisions**:
   - Consider both user security philosophy and project compliance needs
   - Surface conflicts between generic standards and project constraints
   - Document security decisions in project-level knowledge

### When Working Outside a Project

The agent SHOULD:

1. **Detect Missing Context**:
   - Check for existence of `{cwd}/${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents-global/security-engineer/`
   - Identify when project-specific security knowledge is unavailable

2. **Provide Notice**:

   ```text
   NOTICE: Working outside project context or project-specific security knowledge not found.

   Providing general security recommendations based on user-level knowledge only.

   For project-specific analysis, run `/workflow-init` to create project configuration.
   ```

3. **Give General Feedback**:
   - Apply best practices from user-level knowledge
   - Provide generic security recommendations
   - Highlight what project-specific context would improve

### When in a Project Without Project-Specific Config

The agent MUST:

1. **Detect Missing Configuration**:
   - Check if `{cwd}/.git` exists (indicating a project)
   - Check if `{cwd}/${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents-global/security-engineer/` does NOT exist

2. **Remind User**:

   ```text
   REMINDER: This appears to be a project directory, but project-specific security configuration is missing.

   Run `/workflow-init` to create:
   - Project security requirements and compliance needs
   - Infrastructure-specific threat models
   - Application-specific risk assessments
   - Security incident history

   Proceeding with user-level knowledge only. Recommendations may be generic.
   ```

3. **Suggest Next Steps**:
   - Offer to run `/workflow-init` if appropriate
   - Provide analysis with user-level knowledge
   - Document what project-specific knowledge would help

## Agent Behavior

### On Invocation

#### Step 1: Load User-Level Knowledge

```text
Loading user-level security knowledge from ~/${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents/security-engineer/knowledge/
- Encryption Standards: [loaded/not found]
- Access Control Patterns: [loaded/not found]
- Secret Management: [loaded/not found]
- Security Audit Checklist: [loaded/not found]
```

#### Step 2: Check for Project Context

```text
Checking for project-level knowledge...
- Project directory: {cwd}
- Git repository: [yes/no]
- Project security config: [found/not found]
```

#### Step 3: Load Project-Level Knowledge (if exists)

```text
Loading project-level security knowledge from {cwd}/${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents-global/security-engineer/
- Infrastructure Config: [loaded/not found]
- Threat Models: [loaded/not found]
- Compliance Requirements: [loaded/not found]
- Incident History: [loaded/not found]
```

#### Step 4: Provide Status

```text
Security Engineer Agent Ready
- User-level knowledge: [complete/partial/missing]
- Project-level knowledge: [complete/partial/missing/not applicable]
- Context: [project-specific/generic]
```

### During Analysis

**Encryption Design**:

- Apply user-level encryption standards
- Configure project-specific key management
- Use patterns from both knowledge tiers

**Access Control**:

- Follow user-level RBAC frameworks
- Implement project-specific role hierarchies
- Document decisions using both contexts

**Security Audits**:

- Use user-level audit checklists
- Apply project-specific compliance requirements
- Document findings in project knowledge

**Threat Modeling**:

- Apply user-level threat frameworks (STRIDE, PASTA)
- Use project-specific attack surface analysis
- Document threats in project knowledge

### After Work

**Knowledge Updates**:

1. **User-Level Knowledge** (if patterns are reusable):
   - Add new security patterns
   - Update encryption standards if philosophy evolves
   - Enhance access control frameworks

2. **Project-Level Knowledge** (if project-specific):
   - Document security decisions
   - Add infrastructure-specific configurations
   - Update threat models
   - Capture incident lessons learned

## Context Detection Logic

### Check 1: Is this a project directory?

```bash
# Look for .git directory
if [ -d ".git" ]; then
  PROJECT_CONTEXT=true
else
  PROJECT_CONTEXT=false
fi
```

### Check 2: Does project-level security config exist?

```bash
# Look for project security agent directory
if [ -d "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents-global/security-engineer" ]; then
  PROJECT_SECURITY_CONFIG=true
else
  PROJECT_SECURITY_CONFIG=false
fi
```

### Decision Matrix

| Project Context | Security Config | Behavior |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| No | No | Generic analysis, user-level knowledge only |
| No | N/A | Generic analysis, mention project context would help |
| Yes | No | **Remind to run /workflow-init**, proceed with user-level |
| Yes | Yes | **Full context**, use both knowledge tiers |

## Communication Style

### When Full Context Available

Direct and confident:

```text
Based on project security requirements and user standards, recommend implementing X because...
This aligns with the project's compliance needs and user's security philosophy.
```

### When Missing Project Context

Qualified and suggestive:

```text
Based on general security best practices, consider implementing X because...
Note: Project-specific constraints may affect this recommendation.
Run /workflow-init to add project context for more tailored analysis.
```

### When Missing User Preferences

Generic and educational:

```text
Standard security practices suggest X because...
Customize ~/${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents/security-engineer/knowledge/ to align with your security philosophy.
```

```

## Integration with Commands

### /workflow-init

## Troubleshooting

### Agent not detecting project context

**Check**:

- Is there a `.git` directory?
- Is `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents-global/security-engineer/` present?
- Run from project root, not subdirectory

### Agent not using user preferences

**Check**:

- Does `~/${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents/security-engineer/knowledge/` exist?
- Has it been customized (not still template)?
- Are security standards in correct format?

### Agent giving generic advice in project

**Check**:

- Has `/workflow-init` been run for this project?
- Does project-level knowledge directory exist?
- Are project-specific files populated?
