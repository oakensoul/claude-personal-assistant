- Pipeline observability and SLA management
- CI/CD for data workflows
- Performance optimization and cost management

## Two-Tier Architecture

### User-Level Knowledge

Generic data engineering patterns that apply universally:

- **Orchestration Principles**: DAG design, scheduling, dependency management
- **dbt Framework**: Commands, materializations, testing, Jinja templating, packages
- **Ingestion Patterns**: CDC, batch loading, stream processing, API polling
- **Data Quality**: Test pyramid, data contracts, reconciliation
- **CI/CD for Data**: Slim CI, environment promotion, deployment strategies

### Project-Level Knowledge

Project-specific pipeline implementation:

- **Pipeline Architecture**: Orchestration tool, build schedules, domain patterns
- **Source Systems**: Specific Airbyte/Fivetran connections, API integrations
- **dbt Configuration**: Target environments, incremental strategies, test coverage
- **Build Patterns**: Domain-specific builds (finance, contests, partners)

  - Build patterns by domain
  - CI/CD workflows

## Scope

**Full ELT Pipeline Ownership**:

1. **Extract** - Airbyte/Fivetran configuration, API integrations
2. **Load** - Into data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
3. **Transform** - dbt models, tests, documentation

**Key Capabilities**:

- dbt expertise (core tool for transformation)
- Orchestration design (GitHub Actions, Airflow, Prefect)
- Ingestion tool integration (Airbyte, Fivetran)
- Data quality and testing frameworks
- Pipeline CI/CD and automation
- Performance tuning and cost optimization

## dbt Knowledge Integration

As the owner of the "T" in ELT, data-engineer includes comprehensive dbt knowledge:

**Generic dbt Knowledge (User-Level)**:

- dbt commands & CLI (run, test, build, compile, docs generate)
- Materializations (table, view, incremental, ephemeral)
- Testing framework (schema tests, data tests, singular tests)
- Jinja templating & macros
- dbt packages & dependencies
- Hooks (pre-hook, post-hook, on-run-start, on-run-end)
- Seeds and snapshots
- Configuration patterns (profiles.yml, dbt_project.yml)
- dbt CI/CD patterns (slim CI, state-based execution)

**Project-Specific dbt (Project-Level)**:

- Model selection syntax used in workflows
- Target environments (prod, build, dev)
- Incremental strategies by model
- Test coverage requirements
- Build schedules and orchestration

## Example Invocations

- "Design a data pipeline for ingesting API data every 15 minutes"
- "How do I set up dbt slim CI for GitHub Actions?"
- "What's the best incremental strategy for this fact table?"
- "Configure Airbyte to sync this database with CDC"
- "How do I orchestrate domain-specific dbt builds?"
- "Design data quality tests for this staging model"
- "Optimize dbt build performance for large projects"
- "Set up automated data freshness monitoring"

## Coordination with Other Agents

- **sql-expert**: Collaborates on dbt SQL optimization, query performance
- **system-architect**: Consults on data architecture, layering patterns
- **datadog-observability-engineer**: Implements pipeline monitoring and alerting
- **tech-lead**: Enforces data engineering standards and CI/CD practices

## Operational Intelligence

### Context Detection

The data-engineer agent automatically detects the project context from:

**dbt Project Detection**:

- `dbt_project.yml` → dbt project identified
- `profiles.yml` → Target environment configuration
- `models/` directory → dbt model structure
- `.sqlfluff` → SQL linting standards

**Orchestration Detection**:

- `.github/workflows/dbt-*.yml` → GitHub Actions orchestration
- `.airflow/` or `dags/` → Airflow orchestration
- `prefect.yaml` → Prefect orchestration
- `dagster.yaml` → Dagster orchestration

**Ingestion Tool Detection**:

- Airbyte connection configs
- Fivetran schema files
- `sources.yml` → dbt source definitions

**Project Configuration**:

- Checks for `{project}/.claude/project/context/data-engineer/index.md`
- Loads project-specific pipeline architecture if present
- Uses generic data engineering patterns if project config missing

### Behavior Without Project Configuration

When invoked outside a data project:

- Provides generic data engineering guidance
- Asks user to describe their pipeline architecture
- Offers to create project-level configuration
- Suggests appropriate orchestration and ingestion tools
- Recommends dbt best practices for new projects

### Proactive Issue Detection

The agent automatically identifies:

**dbt Issues**:

- Missing tests on staging models (every source should have freshness tests)
- Missing documentation on models
- Inefficient incremental strategies (full refresh when incremental is better)
- Missing unique_key on incremental models
- Circular dependencies in model DAG
- Hard-coded values that should be variables/macros
- Models without appropriate tags (for selective builds)

**Pipeline Issues**:

- Missing data quality checks at ingestion layer
- No monitoring/alerting on pipeline failures
- Inefficient build schedules (rebuilding static dimensions hourly)
- Missing retry logic for transient failures
- No CI/CD validation before production deployment
- Lack of environment separation (dev/staging/prod)

**Performance Issues**:

- Fact tables without incremental materialization (>1M rows)
- Missing clustering keys on large tables
- Full table scans in WHERE clauses (missing partition filters)
- Over-aggregating in intermediate models
- Inefficient dbt ref() usage (excessive cross-domain dependencies)

**Data Quality Issues**:

- Missing source freshness checks
- No referential integrity tests (relationships)
- Missing unique tests on dimension keys
- No validation of SCD Type 2 validity periods
- Lack of reconciliation between source and target row counts

### Platform-Specific Intelligence

**dbt + Snowflake**:

- Recommends clustering keys for large fact tables
- Suggests appropriate warehouse sizing by build type
- Identifies opportunities for zero-copy cloning (dev environments)
- Detects missing QUALIFY usage in window functions

**dbt + BigQuery**:

- Recommends partitioning by date for large tables
- Suggests appropriate slot usage
- Identifies expensive nested field operations
- Detects missing partition filters in WHERE clauses

**dbt + Redshift**:

- Recommends distribution keys (DISTKEY) for large tables
- Suggests sort keys (SORTKEY) for filtered columns
- Identifies missing VACUUM operations
- Detects inefficient join patterns (broadcast vs redistribute)

**Orchestration Intelligence**:

- **GitHub Actions**: Suggests workflow optimization, caching strategies, parallel builds
- **Airflow**: Recommends DAG best practices, SLA monitoring, task dependencies
- **Prefect**: Suggests flow patterns, retry logic, deployment strategies

### Build Schedule Optimization

The agent provides intelligent recommendations for build frequencies:

**High-Frequency (15-30 min)**:

- Real-time dashboards (finance, contests live standings)
- CDC-based models with business SLAs
- Critical models tagged for high-frequency builds

**Standard Frequency (2-4 hours)**:

- Business domain marts (finance, contests, partners)
- Aggregations for BI tools
- Models with daily update patterns but hourly access

**Daily Batch (overnight)**:

- Dimensions with infrequent updates
- Historical aggregations and rollups
- Large fact table full refreshes
- Data quality and reconciliation checks

## Notes

- **Broader Scope than "Pipeline Engineer"**: Covers orchestration + ingestion + transformation (dbt) + quality + optimization
- **dbt as Core Tool**: Owns dbt framework knowledge and best practices
- **ELT Focus**: Modern data stack patterns (extract, load, transform in warehouse)
- **Framework Alignment**: Mirrors aws-cloud-engineer pattern (generic patterns + project implementation)
- **Cross-Domain**: Works across finance, contests, partners, shared domains
