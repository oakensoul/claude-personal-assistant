# Cost Attribution Frameworks

Cost attribution enables organizations to allocate Snowflake costs to specific teams, projects, or business units for accountability and budgeting. This guide covers tagging strategies, chargeback models, and implementation patterns.

## Why Cost Attribution Matters

**Business Benefits**:

- **Budget Accountability**: Teams understand their actual data platform costs
- **Optimization Incentives**: Cost visibility drives efficiency improvements
- **Fair Allocation**: Shared infrastructure costs distributed appropriately
- **ROI Tracking**: Connect data investments to business outcomes
- **Capacity Planning**: Predict future costs by team/project growth

**Technical Benefits**:

- Identify expensive workloads for optimization
- Track cost trends by business domain
- Justify infrastructure investments with usage data
- Support multi-tenant cost isolation

## Attribution Methods

### 1. Warehouse-Based Attribution

**Approach**: Dedicate warehouses to specific teams/projects.

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Create team-specific warehouses
CREATE WAREHOUSE finance_team_wh
WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM'
     AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
     AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;

CREATE WAREHOUSE analytics_team_wh
WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL'
     AUTO_SUSPEND = 120
     AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;

-- Grant usage to specific roles
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE finance_team_wh TO ROLE finance_analyst;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE analytics_team_wh TO ROLE analytics_engineer;
```

**Cost Attribution Query**:
```sql
SELECT
    warehouse_name,
    SUM(credits_used) AS total_credits,
    SUM(credits_used) * 2.5 AS cost_usd
FROM snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history
WHERE start_time >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP BY warehouse_name
ORDER BY total_credits DESC;
```

**Pros**:

- Simple, direct attribution
- No ambiguity (warehouse = team)
- Easy to implement resource monitors per team

**Cons**:

- Warehouse proliferation (management overhead)
- Inefficient resource utilization (small teams underutilize)
- Cannot attribute shared warehouse costs

**Best For**: Teams with distinct workload patterns and high autonomy.

### 2. Tag-Based Attribution

**Approach**: Tag Snowflake objects (warehouses, databases, tables) with cost center metadata.

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Create cost attribution tags
CREATE TAG cost_center;
CREATE TAG project_id;
CREATE TAG department;

-- Apply tags to warehouses
ALTER WAREHOUSE dbt_prod_wh SET TAG cost_center = 'data_engineering';
ALTER WAREHOUSE dbt_prod_wh SET TAG project_id = 'finance_dwh';

ALTER WAREHOUSE metabase_wh SET TAG cost_center = 'business_intelligence';
ALTER WAREHOUSE metabase_wh SET TAG department = 'finance';

-- Apply tags to databases/schemas
ALTER DATABASE PROD SET TAG cost_center = 'shared_infrastructure';
ALTER SCHEMA PROD.FINANCE_STAGING SET TAG cost_center = 'data_engineering';
ALTER SCHEMA PROD.FINANCE_STAGING SET TAG project_id = 'finance_dwh';
```

**Cost Attribution Query**:
```sql
SELECT
    w.warehouse_name,
    SYSTEM$GET_TAG('cost_center', w.warehouse_name, 'WAREHOUSE') AS cost_center,
    SYSTEM$GET_TAG('project_id', w.warehouse_name, 'WAREHOUSE') AS project_id,
    SUM(m.credits_used) AS total_credits,
    SUM(m.credits_used) * 2.5 AS cost_usd
FROM snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history m
JOIN snowflake.account_usage.warehouses w
    ON m.warehouse_name = w.name
WHERE m.start_time >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP BY w.warehouse_name, cost_center, project_id
ORDER BY total_credits DESC;
```

**Pros**:

- Flexible (multiple tags per resource)
- No warehouse proliferation needed
- Supports hierarchical attribution (department → team → project)

**Cons**:

- Requires consistent tagging discipline
- Tag changes not historically tracked
- Shared warehouses still require allocation logic

**Best For**: Organizations with shared infrastructure and matrix team structures.

### 3. Query-Based Attribution

**Approach**: Attribute costs based on actual query execution and user activity.

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Cost by user (approximate)
WITH user_query_costs AS (
    SELECT
        user_name,
        warehouse_name,
        warehouse_size,
        SUM(execution_time) / 1000 AS total_execution_seconds,
        -- Approximate credits
        SUM(
            CASE warehouse_size
                WHEN 'X-Small' THEN execution_time / 1000 / 3600 * 1
                WHEN 'Small' THEN execution_time / 1000 / 3600 * 2
                WHEN 'Medium' THEN execution_time / 1000 / 3600 * 4
                WHEN 'Large' THEN execution_time / 1000 / 3600 * 8
                ELSE execution_time / 1000 / 3600 * 4
            END
        ) AS estimated_credits
    FROM snowflake.account_usage.query_history
    WHERE start_time >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
    GROUP BY user_name, warehouse_name, warehouse_size
)
SELECT
    user_name,
    SUM(estimated_credits) AS total_credits,
    SUM(estimated_credits) * 2.5 AS estimated_cost_usd
FROM user_query_costs
GROUP BY user_name
ORDER BY total_credits DESC;
```

**Pros**:

- Granular attribution (query-level)
- Reflects actual usage patterns
- Can attribute shared warehouse costs proportionally

**Cons**:

- Approximate (doesn't account for idle time, auto-suspend delays)
- Complex calculation (requires warehouse size mapping)
- Doesn't include serverless features (clustering, Snowpipe)

**Best For**: Ad-hoc analysis, understanding user behavior, supplementing warehouse-based attribution.

### 4. Hybrid Attribution Model

**Approach**: Combine warehouse-based, tag-based, and query-based methods for comprehensive attribution.

**Example Structure**:

```yaml
Primary_Attribution: Warehouse ownership (finance_wh → Finance team)
Secondary_Attribution: Tags for projects within team (project_id tag)
Tertiary_Attribution: Query-level for shared warehouses (proportional split)
```

**Implementation**:

```sql
-- Step 1: Direct warehouse attribution
WITH warehouse_costs AS (
    SELECT
        w.warehouse_name,
        SYSTEM$GET_TAG('cost_center', w.warehouse_name, 'WAREHOUSE') AS cost_center,
        SYSTEM$GET_TAG('project_id', w.warehouse_name, 'WAREHOUSE') AS project_id,
        SUM(m.credits_used) AS warehouse_credits
    FROM snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history m
    JOIN snowflake.account_usage.warehouses w ON m.warehouse_name = w.name
    WHERE m.start_time >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
    GROUP BY w.warehouse_name, cost_center, project_id
),

-- Step 2: Storage costs (allocated by database tags)
storage_costs AS (
    SELECT
        table_catalog AS database_name,
        SYSTEM$GET_TAG('cost_center', table_catalog, 'DATABASE') AS cost_center,
        SUM(active_bytes + time_travel_bytes + failsafe_bytes) / POWER(1024, 4) AS storage_tb
    FROM snowflake.account_usage.table_storage_metrics
    WHERE active_bytes > 0
    GROUP BY database_name, cost_center
)

-- Step 3: Combine compute + storage
SELECT
    COALESCE(wc.cost_center, sc.cost_center, 'unallocated') AS cost_center,
    wc.project_id,
    SUM(wc.warehouse_credits) AS compute_credits,
    SUM(sc.storage_tb * 40 / 2.5) AS storage_credits_equivalent,  -- $40/TB ÷ $2.50/credit
    SUM(wc.warehouse_credits) + SUM(sc.storage_tb * 40 / 2.5) AS total_credits,
    (SUM(wc.warehouse_credits) + SUM(sc.storage_tb * 40 / 2.5)) * 2.5 AS total_cost_usd
FROM warehouse_costs wc
FULL OUTER JOIN storage_costs sc ON wc.cost_center = sc.cost_center
GROUP BY cost_center, project_id
ORDER BY total_credits DESC;
```

## Chargeback Models

### 1. Showback (Informational Only)

**Definition**: Report costs to teams without financial impact.

**Use Case**: Early-stage cost awareness, building cost culture.

**Implementation**:
- Monthly cost reports by team
- Dashboard showing team usage trends
- No budget enforcement

**Example Report**:

```text
Team: Finance Analytics
Monthly Compute: $2,450 (245 credits @ $10/credit effective rate)
Monthly Storage: $85 (2.1 TB @ $40/TB)
Trend: +15% vs last month
Top Cost Driver: Daily mart refreshes (60% of compute)
```

### 2. Chargeback (Financial Allocation)

**Definition**: Actually bill teams for their Snowflake usage.

**Use Case**: Mature organizations with established cost centers.

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Monthly chargeback calculation
WITH monthly_costs AS (
    -- [Hybrid attribution query from above]
)
SELECT
    cost_center,
    project_id,
    total_cost_usd,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE()) AS billing_period
FROM monthly_costs;
```

**Chargeback Options**:

- **Direct**: Team budgets debited actual costs
- **Tiered**: Fixed tiers (S/M/L) regardless of actual usage
- **Subsidized**: Central IT absorbs base infrastructure, teams pay marginal

### 3. Rate Card Pricing

**Definition**: Internal pricing that may differ from actual Snowflake costs.

**Use Case**: Simplify billing, encourage/discourage certain behaviors.

**Example Rate Card**:
```yaml
Compute:
  X-Small_Warehouse: $5/hour (vs $2.50 actual)
  Medium_Warehouse: $15/hour (vs $10 actual)
  Markup: 50% to cover data engineering overhead

Storage:
  Standard: $50/TB/month (vs $40 actual)
  Archive: $25/TB/month (incentivize archiving)

Queries:
  Dashboard_Query: $0.10/execution (flat rate)
  Ad-hoc_Query: $1.00/execution (encourage self-service optimization)
```

## Best Practices

### Tagging Strategy

1. **Consistent Taxonomy**:

   ```yaml
   Required_Tags:
     - cost_center (department/team owner)
     - environment (prod, dev, staging)

   Optional_Tags:
     - project_id (specific initiative)
     - budget_code (finance system reference)
     - data_classification (PII, confidential, public)
   ```

2. **Tag Governance**:
   - Document tag definitions and allowed values
   - Automated tagging in warehouse creation workflows
   - Regular audits for untagged resources

3. **Hierarchical Tags**:

   ```text
   cost_center: "finance"
   sub_team: "fp_and_a"
   project: "revenue_forecasting"
   ```

### Resource Monitor Integration

**Link Attribution to Budget Controls**:

```sql
-- Create cost-center-specific resource monitor
CREATE RESOURCE MONITOR finance_team_monitor
WITH CREDIT_QUOTA = 500  -- Monthly budget
     FREQUENCY = MONTHLY
     START_TIMESTAMP = IMMEDIATELY
     TRIGGERS
         ON 75 PERCENT DO NOTIFY
         ON 90 PERCENT DO SUSPEND
         ON 100 PERCENT DO SUSPEND_IMMEDIATE;

-- Apply to finance warehouses
ALTER WAREHOUSE finance_team_wh SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = finance_team_monitor;
ALTER WAREHOUSE finance_analyst_wh SET RESOURCE_MONITOR = finance_team_monitor;
```

### Attribution Challenges

**Challenge 1: Shared Warehouses**

- **Solution**: Proportional allocation based on query execution time by user/team

**Challenge 2: Serverless Features**

- **Solution**: Tag databases/tables to attribute clustering, materialized view costs

**Challenge 3: Development vs Production**

- **Solution**: Separate warehouses/databases by environment, tag accordingly

**Challenge 4: Historical Data**

- **Solution**: Tag changes not retroactive; document tag migration dates

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1)

- Define cost attribution taxonomy (cost_center, project_id)
- Tag existing warehouses and databases
- Create basic monthly cost reports by cost_center

### Phase 2: Refinement (Months 2-3)

- Implement hybrid attribution model (warehouse + tags + queries)
- Set up resource monitors for major cost centers
- Establish showback reporting cadence

### Phase 3: Automation (Months 4-6)

- Automated tagging in provisioning workflows
- Self-service cost dashboard for teams
- Anomaly detection and alerts

### Phase 4: Chargeback (Month 6+)

- Transition from showback to chargeback
- Integrate with finance systems
- Optimize based on team feedback

## Example: dbt-splash-prod-v2 Attribution

**Warehouse Mapping**:
```yaml
DBT_PROD_CRITICAL_WH:
  cost_center: data_engineering
  project_id: finance_dwh
  budget: 1000 credits/month

DBT_PROD_HEAVY_WH:
  cost_center: data_engineering
  project_id: segment_analytics
  budget: 2000 credits/month

METABASE_WH:
  cost_center: business_intelligence
  shared: true  # Allocated by query user

ANALYST_WH:
  cost_center: analytics_team
  shared: true  # Ad-hoc usage
```

**Monthly Report**:

```text
Cost Center: Data Engineering
  - finance_dwh project: $2,500 (1,000 credits)
  - segment_analytics project: $5,000 (2,000 credits)
  - Total: $7,500

Cost Center: Business Intelligence
  - Metabase queries: $1,200 (480 credits)
  - Dashboard development: $300 (120 credits)
  - Total: $1,500

Cost Center: Analytics Team
  - Ad-hoc analysis: $800 (320 credits)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Effective cost attribution requires a blend of technical implementation (tags, warehouses) and organizational discipline (governance, reporting). Start with simple warehouse-based attribution, add tags for flexibility, and evolve to query-level granularity as needed. The goal is actionable insights that drive optimization, not perfect precision.
