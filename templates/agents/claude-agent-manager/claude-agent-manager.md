    └── decisions/               # Decision history
```

**For commands:**

```text
${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/commands/{command-name}.md
```

## Model Selection Guide

Choosing the right model for agents and commands is critical for performance and cost efficiency. Use this guide when creating or updating agents/commands.

### Available Models

- **Haiku** (`claude-haiku-4`) - Fastest/cheapest model - For simple, well-defined tasks
- **Default Sonnet** (`claude-sonnet-4.5`) - Standard context window (~200K tokens) - Best for most tasks
- **Extended Context Sonnet** (`sonnet[1m]`) - 1 million token context window - For comprehensive analysis
- **Opus** (`claude-opus-4`) - Maximum reasoning capability - For most complex/critical tasks

### Workflow Strategies

Beyond choosing a single model, consider these workflow strategies:

- **OpusPlan Workflow** - Use Opus during plan mode for superior reasoning, then switch to Sonnet for execution. Best for complex tasks where planning quality matters more than execution speed.
- **Progressive Refinement** - Start with Haiku for quick draft, upgrade to Sonnet for refinement, use Opus for final critical review.
- **Hybrid Approach** - Use different models for different phases (e.g., Opus for architecture, Sonnet[1m] for implementation, Haiku for cleanup).

### When to Use Haiku (`claude-haiku-4`)

**Use the fastest model when:**

1. **Simple, Well-Defined Tasks**
   - Single-purpose utility operations
   - Template-based generation with clear rules
   - Straightforward file operations
   - Simple reformatting or cleanup

2. **Speed Priority**
   - Interactive commands needing fast feedback
   - Rapid iteration workflows
   - Time-sensitive operations

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - High-volume routine tasks
   - Simple repetitive operations
   - Tasks with clear, unambiguous requirements

**Trade-offs**: Fastest and cheapest, but limited reasoning capability. Not suitable for complex decisions or nuanced requirements.

### When to Use Opus (`claude-opus-4`)

**Use the most capable model when:**

1. **Critical Architectural Decisions**
   - Designing system architecture from scratch
   - Making foundational technology choices
   - Complex refactoring of core systems
   - High-stakes technical decisions

2. **Novel Problem-Solving**
   - Tackling unfamiliar problem domains
   - Creative solution design
   - Complex algorithm design
   - Situations requiring maximum reasoning capability

3. **Maximum Accuracy Required**
   - Production-critical code generation
   - Security-sensitive implementations
   - Financial or healthcare applications
   - When mistakes are very costly

4. **Complex Multi-Step Reasoning**
   - Intricate debugging of subtle bugs
   - Performance optimization requiring deep analysis
   - Complex migration planning
   - Situations requiring extensive logical chains

**Trade-offs**: Slower and more expensive than Sonnet, but highest capability

### When to Use 1M Context (`sonnet[1m]`)

**Use the extended context model when:**

1. **Comprehensive Codebase Analysis Required**
   - Agent/command needs to understand entire project structure
   - Cross-file dependencies are critical
   - Making decisions based on patterns across many files

2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration**
   - Command coordinates multiple agents
   - Requires maintaining context across agent invocations
   - Synthesizes outputs from multiple sources

3. **Complex Document Generation**
   - Generating comprehensive documentation
   - Analyzing large codebases for documentation targets
   - Creating PRDs, tech specs, or implementation plans

4. **Deep Context Requirements**
   - Loading multiple large analysis documents (PRD, TECH_SPEC, etc.)
   - Processing extensive issue history or requirements
   - Maintaining state across complex workflows

**Trade-offs**: Slower and more expensive than default Sonnet, but handles large context

### When to Use Default Sonnet

**Use the default model when:**

1. **Standard Development Tasks**
   - Single or multi-file edits
   - Moderate complexity operations
   - Standard code generation and refactoring

2. **Balanced Requirements**
   - Good reasoning needed but not critical
   - Moderate context requirements
   - Standard workflows and patterns

3. **Best Overall Value**
   - Good balance of speed/cost/capability
   - Most common development scenarios
   - Default choice for most agents/commands

## Examples

### Example: Creating a New Agent

```text
User: "I need an agent to handle API design tasks"

Agent Questions:
1. What should this agent be called? (Suggest: api-design-architect)
2. What are its core responsibilities?
3. When should Claude invoke this agent instead of handling directly?
4. What knowledge/documentation will it need?
5. Any special configuration? (color, temperature)

Agent Creates:
- ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents/api-design-architect.md (with frontmatter)
- ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents/api-design-architect/knowledge/ (directory)
- ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents/api-design-architect/knowledge/index.md (catalog)
- Updates CLAUDE.md with agent documentation

Agent Confirms:
"✓ Created api-design-architect agent
- Agent file: ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents/api-design-architect.md
- Knowledge base: ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents/api-design-architect/knowledge/
- CLAUDE.md updated

Next steps: Add documentation to knowledge/core-concepts/"
```

### Example: Creating a New Command

```text
User: "Create a /analyze-performance command"

Agent Questions:
1. What should this command analyze?
2. What arguments does it need? (required/optional)
3. What are the workflow steps?
4. How should errors be handled?
5. Which agent should handle the work?

Agent Creates:
- ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/commands/analyze-performance.md (with frontmatter and workflow)

Agent Confirms:
"✓ Created /analyze-performance command
- Command file: ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/commands/analyze-performance.md
- Invokes: performance-auditor agent

Usage: /analyze-performance [target]"
```

## Error Handling
