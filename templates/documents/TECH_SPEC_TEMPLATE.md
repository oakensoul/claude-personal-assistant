## Notes for Tech Leads

**Keep it actionable**:

- Focus on "how" not just "what"
- Provide enough detail for implementation without micro-managing
- Call out decisions explicitly with rationale

**Decisions are critical**:

- Document the decision, alternatives, and rationale
- Future you (or future devs) need context
- Trade-offs should be explicit

**Test strategy matters**:

- Don't just say "write tests"
- Specify what needs testing and why
- Call out edge cases and risk areas

**Open questions are normal**:

- Some things can't be known upfront
- Document what needs investigation
- Update spec as questions are answered

**Balance detail vs. brevity**:

- Enough detail to implement confidently
- Not so much detail it's never read
- Use diagrams where they help

**Spec is living document**:

- Update as implementation reveals new information
- Track what actually got built vs. planned
- Keep team aligned on current approach
