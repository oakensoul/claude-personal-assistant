# Expert Analysis Command

Orchestrates multi-agent analysis of the current issue to produce Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Technical Specification. Coordinates Product Manager, Tech Lead, and specialist agents to ensure comprehensive requirement analysis and technical planning.

## Usage

```bash
/expert-analysis
```text

**Prerequisites**:

- Must have run `/start-work <issue-id>` first (requires active issue)
- Expert analysis must be enabled in `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/workflow-config.json`
- Product Manager and Tech Lead agents must be configured

## Instructions

### 1. Validate Prerequisites

- **Check Active Issue**:
  - Verify `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/workflow-config.json` exists and has `expert_analysis.enabled = true`
  - Check for active issue in configured issue tracking directory
  - Pattern: `{issue_tracking.directory}/{in_progress}/issue-{id}/`
  - If no active issue found: Display error and suggest running `/start-work <issue-id>` first
  - If multiple active issues: Ask user which one to analyze

- **Load Configuration**:
  - Read `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/workflow-config.json`
  - Extract `expert_analysis` section
  - Validate Product Manager agent exists: `~/${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents/product-manager/`
  - Validate Tech Lead agent exists: `~/${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/agents/tech-lead/`
  - If either missing: Display error and suggest running `/workflow-init` first

- **Load Issue Details**:
  - Read `{issue_tracking.directory}/{in_progress}/issue-{id}/README.md`
  - Extract issue metadata (title, description, requirements, labels)
  - Store for agent context

### 2. Check for Existing Analysis (Idempotency)

- **Check for existing documents**:
  - Check if `{issue-folder}/PRD.md` exists
  - Check if `{issue-folder}/TECH_SPEC.md` exists
  - Check if `{issue-folder}/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` exists

- **If all documents exist** (complete analysis):
  - Display:

    ```
    ‚úì Expert analysis already complete for issue #{id}

    Existing Documents:
    ‚Ä¢ PRD.md
    ‚Ä¢ TECH_SPEC.md
    ‚Ä¢ IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

    How would you like to proceed?
    [1] Skip - Use existing analysis (recommended)
    [2] Update - Re-run Q&A and update documents
    [3] Regenerate - Start fresh, overwrite all documents
    [4] Cancel
    ```

  - Handle choice:
    - Option 1 (Skip): Exit successfully (true idempotent)
    - Option 2 (Update): Skip to step 5 (Q&A phase), update documents based on new answers
    - Option 3 (Regenerate): Continue to step 3 normally
    - Option 4 (Cancel): Exit command

- **If partial documents exist** (incomplete analysis):
  - Detect which documents are missing
  - Display:

    ```
    ‚ö† Partial analysis detected for issue #{id}

    Existing: {list existing docs}
    Missing: {list missing docs}

    How would you like to proceed?
    [1] Resume - Continue from where left off
    [2] Regenerate - Start fresh, overwrite existing
    [3] Cancel
    ```

  - Handle choice:
    - Option 1 (Resume):
      - If PRD exists, skip to step 4 (Technical Analysis)
      - If TECH_SPEC exists but no summary, skip to step 6 (Implementation Summary)
    - Option 2 (Regenerate): Continue to step 3 normally
    - Option 3 (Cancel): Exit command

- **If no documents exist**: Continue to step 3 normally

{
  "workflow": {
    "expert_analysis": {
      "enabled": true,
      "product_manager": {
        "agent": "product-manager",
        "domain": "Developer Tools",
        "patterns": ["open source"]
      },
      "tech_lead": {
        "agent": "tech-lead",
        "philosophy": "pragmatic",
        "tech_stack": ["bash", "javascript"]
      },
      "agents": {
        "product": ["configuration-specialist", "integration-specialist"],
        "technical": ["shell-script-specialist", "devops-engineer"]
      },
      "qa_mode": "interactive",
      "document_format": "concise"
    }
  }
}
```text

## Document Templates

### PRD_TEMPLATE.md

Located at: `templates/documents/PRD_TEMPLATE.md`

Defines structure for Product Requirements Documents:

- Executive Summary
- Stakeholder Analysis
- Requirements (Functional & Non-Functional)
- Success Criteria
- Open Questions
- Recommendations

### TECH_SPEC_TEMPLATE.md

Located at: `templates/documents/TECH_SPEC_TEMPLATE.md`

Defines structure for Technical Specifications:

- Architecture Overview
- Technical Decisions
- Implementation Plan
- Technical Risks
- Testing Strategy
- Effort Estimate

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# After starting work on issue
/start-work 42

# Run expert analysis
/expert-analysis

# System orchestrates:
# 1. Product agents analyze requirements
# 2. PM creates PRD
# 3. Technical agents analyze implementation
# 4. Tech Lead creates TECH_SPEC
# 5. Q&A iteration
# 6. Implementation summary

# Review results
cat .github/issues/in-progress/issue-42/PRD.md
cat .github/issues/in-progress/issue-42/TECH_SPEC.md
cat .github/issues/in-progress/issue-42/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
```text

### With Custom Agents

```bash
# workflow-config.json configured with domain-specific agents
{
  "expert_analysis": {
    "agents": {
      "product": [
        "larp-product-manager",
        "privacy-security-auditor"
      ],
      "technical": [
        "php-engineer",
        "strapi-backend-engineer",
        "api-design-architect"
      ]
    }
  }
}

# Analysis uses LARP-specific product expertise
# and PHP/Strapi technical expertise
/expert-analysis
```text

## Error Handling

- **No active issue**: Display error, suggest `/start-work <issue-id>`
- **Expert analysis disabled**: Display error, suggest `/workflow-init`
- **Missing PM/Tech Lead**: Display error, suggest `/workflow-init`
- **Agent invocation fails**: Log error, continue with available analyses
- **Document template missing**: Use inline template structure
- **Permission errors**: Display error with file path and permissions needed

## Performance Notes

- **Parallel agent execution**: Product and technical agents run in parallel for speed
- **Large issue context**: May hit token limits with very large requirements
- **Agent selection**: More agents = more comprehensive but slower analysis
- **Document format**: "concise" mode significantly reduces token usage

## Integration with Workflow

1. `/workflow-init` - Configures expert analysis, creates PM/Tech Lead agents
2. `/create-issue` - Creates issue (optional: run expert analysis automatically?)
3. `/start-work` - Starts work on issue, sets up issue folder
4. `/expert-analysis` - **THIS COMMAND** - Analyzes issue, creates PRD/TECH_SPEC
5. Implementation work - Developer codes based on PRD/TECH_SPEC
6. `/track-time` - Logs time during implementation
7. `/open-pr` - Creates PR with links to PRD/TECH_SPEC

## Related Commands

- `/workflow-init` - Configure expert analysis workflow
- `/start-work <issue-id>` - Required before running expert analysis
- `/open-pr` - Can reference PRD/TECH_SPEC in PR body

## Notes

- **Concise documents**: User preference is bullet points over flowery prose
- **Parallel execution**: Agents work simultaneously, PM/Tech Lead consolidate
- **Iterative Q&A**: Ensures all questions answered before implementation
- **Agent expertise**: Product agents focus on requirements, technical agents focus on implementation
- **Knowledge accumulation**: PM and Tech Lead learn from each analysis (stored in agent knowledge)

---

**Design Philosophy**: Automate comprehensive requirement analysis through coordinated expert agents while maintaining human decision-making on key questions.
