# My Custom Workflow

This is a custom command I created for my personal project workflow.

## Purpose

Automates my daily development routine:

1. Check calendar for meetings
2. Review GitHub notifications
3. Update task tracking
4. Generate daily standup notes

## Usage

Invoke this command at the start of each workday:

```bash
/my-workflow
```

## Implementation

When invoked, perform the following steps:

1. **Calendar Check**: Review today's calendar events
2. **GitHub Review**: Check assigned issues and PRs
3. **Task Update**: Update task status in Obsidian
4. **Standup Generation**: Create standup notes from activity

## Notes

This is user-generated content and should be preserved during AIDA framework upgrades!

**CRITICAL**: This file lives in `~/.claude/commands/my-workflow.md` (NOT in `.aida/` namespace) and represents user content that must never be touched by installer.
