# Implement full Obsidian integration

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Epic Breakdown Required**: This is a Large effort issue that should be broken down into smaller, more atomic issues before milestone work begins. This breakdown should happen during sprint planning for v0.4.0.

## Description

Implement comprehensive Obsidian integration that goes beyond basic templates to include bidirectional sync, automatic note creation/updates, task synchronization, and knowledge management within Obsidian vault.

## Suggested Breakdown

When breaking down this epic, consider creating separate issues for:

1. **Bidirectional Task Sync** - Sync tasks between AIDA and Obsidian tasks plugin
2. **Automatic Daily Notes** - Create and update daily notes in Obsidian vault
3. **Knowledge Sync** - Export knowledge entries to Obsidian with backlinks
4. **Decision Records Sync** - Export ADRs/PDRs to Obsidian with proper formatting
5. **Project Notes Integration** - Create and maintain project notes in Obsidian
6. **Vault Configuration** - Configurable vault location, structure, and templates
7. **Conflict Resolution** - Handle concurrent edits and sync conflicts
8. **Obsidian CLI Commands** - Commands for manual sync and operations

Each sub-issue should be scoped to Small or Medium effort.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bidirectional task sync between AIDA and Obsidian
- [ ] Automatic daily note creation and updates
- [ ] Knowledge entries sync to Obsidian vault
- [ ] Decision records (ADRs) sync to Obsidian
- [ ] Project notes creation and tracking in Obsidian
- [ ] Configurable vault location and structure
- [ ] Template customization support
- [ ] Dataview query compatibility
- [ ] Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- [ ] CLI commands for Obsidian operations
- [ ] Real-time or scheduled sync modes

sync:
  mode: "realtime"  # or "scheduled", "manual"
  interval: 300     # seconds (for scheduled mode)
  conflict_resolution: "prompt"  # or "aida-wins", "obsidian-wins", "merge"

structure:
  daily_notes: "Daily"
  projects: "Projects"
  learnings: "Learnings"
  decisions: "Decisions/ADR"
  templates: "Templates/AIDA"
  tasks: "Tasks"

templates:

### Bidirectional Task Sync

**AIDA ‚Üí Obsidian**:

```markdown
# Daily Note (2025-10-04)

## Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] Fix production payment bug #urgent #work ‚è∞2025-10-04 üìåaida-001
- [ ] Review PR #123 #code-review #work ‚è∞2025-10-05 üìåaida-002

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Update documentation #documentation ‚è∞2025-10-07 üìåaida-003

### Completed
- [x] Implement authentication ‚úÖ2025-10-04 üìåaida-004
```

**Obsidian ‚Üí AIDA**:

- Parse Obsidian tasks from daily notes
- Extract priority from heading context
- Extract due dates from ‚è∞ notation
- Track task ID with üìå notation
- Sync completion status

**Sync Logic**:

```python
def sync_tasks_bidirectional():
    # Get AIDA tasks
    aida_tasks = get_aida_tasks()

    # Get Obsidian tasks
    obsidian_tasks = parse_obsidian_tasks(vault_path)

    # Find changes
    for task_id in all_task_ids:
        aida_task = aida_tasks.get(task_id)
        obs_task = obsidian_tasks.get(task_id)

        if aida_task and not obs_task:
            # New in AIDA, add to Obsidian
            add_task_to_obsidian(aida_task)

        elif obs_task and not aida_task:
            # New in Obsidian, add to AIDA
            add_task_to_aida(obs_task)

        elif aida_task and obs_task:
            # Exists in both, check for changes
            if aida_task.updated > obs_task.updated:
                update_obsidian_task(aida_task)
            elif obs_task.updated > aida_task.updated:
                update_aida_task(obs_task)
            elif conflict_detected():
                resolve_conflict(aida_task, obs_task)
```text

### Automatic Daily Note Creation

**Morning Routine Integration**:

```bash
$ aida morning

Good morning! Let's plan your day.

Creating today's daily note...
‚úì Created: ~/Knowledge/Obsidian-Vault/Daily/2025-10-04.md

Populating with:
  ‚úì Active projects status
  ‚úì High priority tasks
  ‚úì Today's meetings
  ‚úì Yesterday's accomplishments

Opening in Obsidian...
```

**Daily Note Structure**:

### Knowledge Sync

**AIDA Learning ‚Üí Obsidian Note**:

When user captures knowledge:

```
User: "Remember that React useEffect needs cleanup functions"
AIDA: ‚úì Captured knowledge

      Syncing to Obsidian...
      ‚úì Created: ~/Knowledge/Obsidian-Vault/Learnings/React-useEffect-Cleanup.md
```json

**Obsidian Note**:

```markdown
---
title: "React useEffect Cleanup Functions"
category: React, Best Practices
tags: [react, useEffect, memory-management, hooks]
source: Work on Project Alpha
date_learned: 2025-10-04
created_by: aida
---

# React useEffect Cleanup Functions

## Learning

React useEffect needs cleanup functions for subscriptions to prevent memory leaks.

## Detail

When a useEffect subscribes to events, WebSocket connections, or intervals, it must return a cleanup function that unsubscribes/disconnects when the component unmounts or dependencies change.

## Example

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = dataSource.subscribe(data => {
    setData(data);
  });

  // Cleanup function
  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
}, [dataSource]);
```

## When to Apply

- WebSocket connections
- Event listeners
- setInterval/setTimeout
- Third-party subscriptions

- [[Memory Management in React]]

## Used In

- [[Project Alpha]] (chat feature)
