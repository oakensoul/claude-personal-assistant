# v1.0.0 release preparation and polish

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Epic Breakdown Required**: This is an XLarge effort release issue that should be broken down into smaller, more atomic issues before milestone work begins. This breakdown should happen during sprint planning for v1.0.0.

## Description

Prepare for the v1.0.0 stable release by completing all necessary polish, documentation, testing, security audits, and quality assurance. This represents the first production-ready release of AIDA with stability guarantees and backward compatibility commitments.

## Suggested Breakdown

When breaking down this epic, consider creating separate issues for:

1. **Code Quality & Polish** - Linting, formatting, refactoring, technical debt
2. **Performance Optimization** - Speed improvements, memory optimization
3. **Unit Testing Suite** - Achieve ‚â•80% coverage for core functionality
4. **Integration Testing** - Test all major features working together
5. **End-to-End Testing** - Critical user workflows tested end-to-end
6. **Security Audit** - Comprehensive security review and fixes
7. **User Documentation** - Complete user guides, tutorials, FAQs
8. **API Documentation** - Document all public APIs and interfaces
9. **Migration Guide** - Guide for upgrading from beta versions
10. **Backward Compatibility** - Ensure compatibility guarantees
11. **Release Notes & Changelog** - Comprehensive release documentation
12. **Community Preparation** - GitHub templates, contribution guidelines
13. **Marketing & Announcement** - Prepare release announcement materials

Each sub-issue should be scoped to Small or Medium effort.
