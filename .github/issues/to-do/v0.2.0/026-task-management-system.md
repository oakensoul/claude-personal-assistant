# Implement task management system

## Description

Implement a comprehensive task management system that allows users to capture, organize, prioritize, and track tasks through natural language. Tasks persist across sessions and integrate with the memory system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Natural language task capture: "Remember to update docs"
- [ ] Task prioritization: "High priority: fix prod bug"
- [ ] Task querying: "What tasks do I have?", "Show high priority tasks"
- [ ] Task completion: "I finished updating docs"
- [ ] Task modification: "Change task X to low priority"
- [ ] Task persistence across sessions
- [ ] Task categorization (work, personal, project-specific)
- [ ] Task due dates and reminders
- [ ] Task dependencies tracking
- [ ] Task history and completion tracking
- [ ] Integration with Obsidian (optional)
