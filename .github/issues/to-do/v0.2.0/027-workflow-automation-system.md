# Implement workflow automation system

## Description

Implement a workflow automation system that allows users to define, customize, and execute multi-step workflows for common tasks. Includes built-in workflows for morning/evening routines and support for user-defined workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workflow definition format (YAML-based)
- [ ] Built-in morning routine workflow
- [ ] Built-in evening routine workflow
- [ ] Workflow execution engine
- [ ] Workflow step sequencing and conditional logic
- [ ] Workflow customization per user
- [ ] User-defined workflows support
- [ ] Workflow sharing and import
- [ ] CLI commands for workflow management
- [ ] Context-aware workflow behavior (time of day, project, etc.)

## Implementation Notes

### Workflow Definition Format

```yaml
# ~/.claude/workflows/morning-routine.yaml
---
name: "morning-routine"
display_name: "Morning Routine"
description: "Start-of-day planning and organization"
triggers:
  - command: "aida morning"
  - command: "aida start day"
  - schedule: "weekdays:08:00"  # Auto-run weekdays at 8am (optional)

variables:
  work_start_time: "09:00"
  preferred_task_count: 3

steps:
  - id: "greeting"
    type: "message"
    content: |
      Good morning! Let's plan your day.
      Current time: {{current_time}}
      Today is {{day_of_week}}, {{date}}

  - id: "file-cleanup-check"
    type: "agent"
    agent: "file-manager"
    prompt: "Check if Desktop or Downloads need cleanup"
    condition: "{{day_of_week in ['Monday', 'Friday']}}"  # Only Mon/Fri

  - id: "file-cleanup-action"
    type: "interactive"
    prompt: "Would you like to do a quick 5-minute cleanup?"
    condition: "{{file-cleanup-check.needs_cleanup}}"
    on_yes:
      - type: "agent"

    agent: "secretary"
    prompt: "What are my high priority tasks?"

  - id: "priority-selection"
    type: "interactive"
    prompt: |
      Based on your calendar and tasks, what are your top {{preferred_task_count}} priorities for today?

      Suggestions:
      {{task-review.high_priority_tasks}}

  - id: "focus-time-block"
    type: "agent"
    agent: "secretary"
    prompt: "Identify 2-hour focus time block with no meetings"

  - id: "daily-plan"
    type: "message"
    content: |
      Your Plan for Today:
      ====================

      Meetings & Commitments:
      {{calendar-check.summary}}

      Top Priorities:
      {{priority-selection.selected_tasks}}

      Recommended Focus Time:
      {{focus-time-block.time_block}}

      Ready to start? (Y/n)

  - id: "create-daily-note"
    type: "obsidian"
    action: "create-daily-note"
