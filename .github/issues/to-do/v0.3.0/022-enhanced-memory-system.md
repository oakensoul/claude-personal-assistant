# Implement enhanced memory system

> **Epic**: This is a large feature that has been broken down into smaller, more manageable issues. See the sub-issues below for implementation details.

## Description

Enhance the basic memory system from v0.1.0 to provide structured memory categories, better search and filtering, and memory export capabilities. This transforms memory from simple conversation logs into an organized knowledge system.

## Sub-Issues

This epic is broken down into the following issues:

- #031 - Memory categories and storage structure
- #032 - Memory search and filtering
- #033 - Memory export and import functionality
- #034 - Memory visualization and statistics

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Memory is categorized into distinct types (tasks, knowledge, decisions, preferences, context)
- [ ] Each memory category has its own storage and retrieval mechanism
- [ ] Memory search works across all categories with relevance ranking
- [ ] Memory filtering by date, category, tags, and keywords
- [ ] Memory export functionality for backup and portability
- [ ] Memory import functionality for restoration
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with large memory stores (1000+ entries)
- [ ] Memory visualization shows usage and distribution
- [ ] CLI commands for memory management implemented

## Implementation Notes

### Memory Categories

```text
~/.claude/memory/
├── tasks/
│   ├── active.md
│   ├── completed.md
│   └── archived.md
├── knowledge/
│   ├── learnings.md
│   ├── resources.md
│   └── patterns.md
├── decisions/
│   ├── decisions.md
│   └── adr/

│   ├── current.md
│   └── projects.md
└── history/
    ├── 2025-10.md
    └── 2025-11.md
```

### Memory Storage Format

Each memory entry should have:

```markdown
## [Title/Summary]

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Category**: knowledge|task|decision|preference|context
**Tags**: #tag1 #tag2 #tag3
**Project**: [project-name] (optional)

[Content]

**Related**:
- Link to related memory
- Link to related project
```text

### Memory Search

```bash
# CLI interface
aida memory search "React patterns"
aida memory search --category knowledge --tag react
aida memory search --date 2025-10 --project alpha

# Natural language
"What did I learn about React hooks last week?"
"Show me decisions from October"
"Find tasks related to project alpha"
```

### Memory Export/Import

```bash
# Export all memory
aida memory export --output ~/backups/memory-2025-10-04.tar.gz

# Export specific category
aida memory export --category knowledge --output ~/knowledge-export.json

# Import memory
aida memory import ~/backups/memory-2025-10-04.tar.gz

# Import specific category
aida memory import --category knowledge ~/knowledge-export.json
```text

### Memory Visualization

```bash
$ aida memory stats
