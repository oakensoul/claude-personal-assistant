# Implement knowledge capture mechanism

## Description

Implement the natural language knowledge capture system that allows users to save learnings, insights, and discoveries with automatic categorization, tagging, and organization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Natural language knowledge capture works: "Remember that [learning]"
- [ ] Knowledge categorization by topic and technology
- [ ] Automatic tag extraction and suggestion
- [ ] Knowledge linking to projects and contexts
- [ ] Interactive elaboration prompts
- [ ] Knowledge saved to appropriate location
- [ ] Confirmation message with save location
- [ ] Support for different knowledge types (pattern, technique, insight)
- [ ] CLI command interface works
- [ ] Natural language interface works

## Implementation Notes

### Knowledge Capture Flow

**User Input**:

```text
"Remember that React useEffect needs cleanup functions for subscriptions to prevent memory leaks"
```

**AIDA Response**:

```text
✓ Captured knowledge about React useEffect cleanup

Category: React, Best Practices
Tags: #react #useEffect #memory-management #hooks

Saved to: ~/.claude/memory/knowledge/learnings.md

Would you like to:
  [E] Elaborate with example
  [L] Link to project
  [S] Share to Obsidian
  [D] Done
```

### Natural Language Patterns

Recognize these patterns as knowledge capture requests:

- "Remember that..."
- "I learned that..."
- "Note for later:..."
- "Document this pattern:..."
- "Save this technique:..."
- "Important insight:..."

### CLI Interface

```bash
# Quick capture
aida knowledge capture "React useEffect needs cleanup functions"

# Capture with metadata
aida knowledge capture --category react --tag hooks "useEffect cleanup pattern"

# Capture with project link
aida knowledge capture --project alpha "API rate limiting strategy"

# Capture with type
aida knowledge capture --type pattern "Repository pattern for data access"
```text

### Automatic Categorization

Extract categories from content:

- **Technology keywords**: React, Python, Go, PostgreSQL, etc.
- **Domain keywords**: authentication, API design, testing, deployment
- **Context clues**: "when building X", "for Y applications"

Suggest primary category and subcategories:

```

Detected categories:
  Primary: React
  Secondary: Best Practices, Memory Management

Is this correct? (Y/n)

```text

### Automatic Tagging

Extract tags from content:

- **Technical terms**: useEffect, hooks, cleanup, subscriptions
- **Concepts**: memory-management, patterns, lifecycle
- **Technologies**: react, javascript, frontend

Smart tag suggestions:

```

Suggested tags: #react #useEffect #hooks #memory-management

Additional tags? (comma-separated, or press Enter to continue)

```text

### Interactive Elaboration

After capture, offer to enhance:

```

Knowledge captured! Enhance this entry?

[E] Elaborate with example
    → Prompts for code example or detailed explanation

[L] Link to project
    → Shows active projects to link
    → Adds "Used in: Project Alpha" to entry

[S] Share to Obsidian
    → Creates note in Obsidian vault (if configured)
    → Maintains backlinks

[D] Done
    → Saves as-is

```text

### Knowledge Types

**Learning** (default):

- Simple fact or discovery
- No elaborate structure needed
- Quick capture format

**Pattern**:

- Problem-solution format
- Requires example
- Includes when to use / trade-offs

**Technique**:

- Step-by-step approach
- How-to format
- Includes gotchas

**Insight**:

- Higher-level realization
- Context-driven
- Includes implications

Auto-detect type from keywords:

- "pattern for..." → Pattern
- "how to..." → Technique
- "realized that..." → Insight
- Everything else → Learning
