# Implement decision documentation system

> **Epic**: This feature has been broken down into smaller, more focused issues. See the sub-issues below for implementation details.

## Description

Implement an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) system for documenting important technical and product decisions. This creates a decision history with context, alternatives considered, and rationale.

## Sub-Issues

This epic is broken down into the following issues:

- #037 - ADR system and templates
- #038 - Decision capture and querying

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Natural language decision capture: "Document decision: [decision]"
- [ ] ADR template format (problem, decision, consequences, alternatives)
- [ ] Decision records are numbered and timestamped
- [ ] Decision querying: "Why did we choose PostgreSQL?"
- [ ] Decision history shows evolution and changes
- [ ] Decision linking to projects and contexts
- [ ] Decision reversal tracking (when decisions are changed)
- [ ] Decision export to Obsidian (if configured)
- [ ] Decision status (proposed, accepted, superseded, deprecated)

## Implementation Notes

### ADR Format

Following [Michael Nygard's ADR format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions):

```markdown
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for Project Alpha Database

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Accepted
**Context**: Project Alpha
**Tags**: #database #postgresql #architecture

## Context

Project Alpha needs a database for storing user data, transactions, and analytics. The application requires ACID compliance, complex relational queries, and strong consistency guarantees.

## Decision

We will use PostgreSQL as the primary database for Project Alpha.

## Rationale

- **ACID Compliance**: Strong consistency guarantees required for financial transactions
- **Relational Model**: Complex relationships between users, transactions, and analytics data
- **JSON Support**: Flexibility for semi-structured data without sacrificing relational benefits
- **Mature Ecosystem**: Robust tooling, monitoring, and operational support
- **Team Experience**: Team has strong PostgreSQL experience

## Alternatives Considered

### MongoDB
- **Pros**: Flexible schema, easier horizontal scaling
- **Cons**: Weaker consistency guarantees, less suitable for complex joins
- **Why Not**: ACID compliance is critical for financial data

### MySQL
- **Pros**: Simpler operations, wide adoption
- **Cons**: Less sophisticated JSON support, weaker analytical capabilities
- **Why Not**: PostgreSQL better fits our needs without significant downside

### DynamoDB
- **Pros**: Serverless, built-in scaling
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, learning curve, higher operational complexity
- **Why Not**: Prefer open-source and portable solution

## Consequences

**Positive**:
- Strong data integrity and consistency
- Powerful query capabilities for analytics
- Well-understood operational model
- Good performance characteristics

**Negative**:
- Horizontal scaling more complex than NoSQL
- Requires careful index management
- Schema migrations require planning

**Neutral**:
- Need to set up replication and backups
- Need to monitor query performance

## Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL instance
- [ ] Design schema with proper indexing
- [ ] Configure automated backups
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Document connection pooling strategy

## Related Decisions

- None (first ADR for Project Alpha)

## Superseded By

- None (current decision)

### Decision Capture Flow

**User**: "Document decision: We chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for Project Alpha because we need ACID compliance and complex relational queries"

**AIDA**:
```
Creating Architecture Decision Record...

ADR-003: Use PostgreSQL for Project Alpha Database

I've captured the core decision. Let me help you complete the ADR.

**Context Questions**:
  1. What problem are you solving?
  2. What alternatives did you consider?
  3. What are the consequences (pros/cons)?

Shall I guide you through these, or would you prefer to write the full ADR yourself?
```

### Decision Querying

```bash
# Natural language
"Why did we choose PostgreSQL?"
"Show me database decisions"
"What decisions have we made about Project Alpha?"

# CLI commands
aida decisions list
aida decisions search "database"
aida decisions show 003
aida decisions by-project alpha
aida decisions by-status accepted
```

### Decision Status Workflow

```
Proposed → Accepted → [Superseded|Deprecated]
         ↓
      Rejected
```

**Status Meanings**:
- **Proposed**: Under consideration
- **Accepted**: Active decision
- **Rejected**: Decided against
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer decision (reference new ADR)
- **Deprecated**: No longer recommended but not formally replaced

### Decision Templates

**Technical Decision Template**:
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]
