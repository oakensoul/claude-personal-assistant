# Configuration Specialist Analysis - Issue #33

## Executive Summary

Issue #33 establishes critical configuration infrastructure for cross-repository integration between AIDA and dotfiles. From a configuration management perspective, this introduces version coordination, shared utility sourcing patterns, and configuration validation concerns.

## 1. Domain-Specific Concerns

### Configuration Management

## VERSION File as Single Source of Truth

- Already exists at repository root (currently `0.1.1`)
- Plain text format is correct (single line, semantic version)
- Must be machine-parsable for version comparison logic
- Should remain simple (no metadata, just version string)

## Shared Library Configuration Pattern

- Dotfiles needs to source utilities from `~/.aida/lib/installer-common/`
- Creates implicit dependency on AIDA installation location
- Requires validation that AIDA is installed before sourcing
- Must handle missing or incompatible AIDA gracefully

## Configuration Precedence

- AIDA framework is foundational (installed first)
- Dotfiles consume AIDA configuration/utilities (installed second)
- Private dotfiles overlay both (installed third)
- Clear precedence hierarchy must be maintained

### Validation Requirements

## Version Compatibility Checking

- Dotfiles installer must validate AIDA version before integration
- Need defined compatibility rules (major.minor.patch semantics)
- Error messages must be actionable (e.g., "upgrade AIDA to 0.2.x")
- Should support version range specifications (e.g., ">=0.1.0,<0.3.0")

## Library Sourcing Validation

- Verify `~/.aida/` exists before sourcing
- Check that required utility files exist
- Validate utility functions are loaded correctly
- Provide clear error if utilities unavailable

## Platform Consistency

- Both installers must agree on platform detection
- Shared `platform-detect.sh` ensures consistency
- macOS vs Linux detection must be identical
- Reduces divergence between repositories

### Configuration State Management

## Installation State Tracking

- AIDA installer creates `~/.aida/` (state: AIDA installed)
- Dotfiles installer checks for `~/.aida/` (dependency validation)
- Missing state = clear error message
- Corrupted state = validation fails with recovery instructions

## Cross-Repository Configuration

- AIDA configuration lives in `~/.aida/` and `~/.claude/`
- Dotfiles should NOT modify AIDA's internal state
- Dotfiles can extend/enhance but not replace
- Clear boundaries prevent configuration conflicts

## 2. Stakeholder Impact

### Positive Impacts

## End Users

- Consistent error messages across AIDA and dotfiles installers
- Clear installation order guidance (AIDA first, dotfiles second)
- Version compatibility prevents broken states
- Shared utilities reduce installation bugs

## Developers

- Single source of truth for version management
- Shared utilities reduce code duplication
- Consistent logging/error handling patterns
- Easier to maintain two synchronized repositories

## Integrators

- Clear integration pattern for future repositories
- Documented sourcing mechanism
- Validation utilities are reusable
- Extensible for additional integrations

### Risks and Downsides

## Tight Coupling Risk

- Dotfiles becomes dependent on AIDA structure
- Changes to AIDA utilities can break dotfiles
- Must maintain backward compatibility carefully
- Version coordination becomes critical

## Installation Order Dependency

- Users MUST install AIDA before dotfiles integration
- Breaks if users try dotfiles-first approach
- Error messages must guide users to correct order
- Could confuse users expecting dotfiles to work standalone

## Version Skew Issues

- User installs AIDA 0.1.x
- Dotfiles requires AIDA 0.2.x
- User stuck until they upgrade AIDA
- Need clear upgrade instructions

## Circular Dependency Prevention

- AIDA must NEVER depend on dotfiles
- Dotfiles can depend on AIDA
- Must enforce this in code reviews
- Documentation must make this explicit

## 3. Questions & Clarifications

### Missing Information

## Version Compatibility Rules

- What compatibility semantics do we use?
  - Option A: Strict major.minor match (0.1.x ↔ 0.1.x)
  - Option B: Major match, minor forward compatible (0.1.x → 0.2.x)
  - Option C: Range-based (0.1.0 - 0.3.0)

- Recommendation: Option B with documented breaking changes

## Library Sourcing Pattern

- Should dotfiles source all utilities at once or on-demand?
  - Option A: Source all in installer header
  - Option B: Source only what's needed per function

- Recommendation: Option A for simplicity, Option B for performance

## Error Handling Strategy

- What happens if AIDA version is too old?
  - Option A: Hard fail with error message
  - Option B: Warn but continue (degraded mode)
  - Option C: Auto-upgrade AIDA

- Recommendation: Option A for v0.1, Option C for v1.0

## Utility Function Scope

- Which utilities belong in `installer-common/`?
  - Definitely: colors, logging, validation, platform-detect
  - Maybe: backup utilities, permission management
  - No: AIDA-specific logic, personality selection

- Need clear scope definition

### Decisions Needed

## VERSION File Format

- Current: Single line, plain text semantic version
- Alternatives:
  - JSON: `{"version": "0.1.1", "release_date": "2025-10-06"}`
  - YAML: More metadata, harder to parse in shell

- Decision: Keep plain text for shell compatibility

## Library Directory Structure

```bash
lib/installer-common/
├── colors.sh           # Color codes for output
├── logging.sh          # print_message(), log levels
├── validation.sh       # validate_dependencies(), check_command()
├── platform-detect.sh  # detect_os(), detect_package_manager()
└── version-check.sh    # (NEW) compare_versions(), check_compatibility()
```

- Decision: Add `version-check.sh` for compatibility logic?

## Sourcing Pattern

```bash
# Option A: Source from AIDA installation
if [[ -d ~/.aida/lib/installer-common ]]; then
    source ~/.aida/lib/installer-common/colors.sh
    source ~/.aida/lib/installer-common/logging.sh
    # ... etc
else
    echo "Error: AIDA framework not found. Install AIDA first."
    exit 1
fi

# Option B: Check version, then source
AIDA_VERSION=$(cat ~/.aida/VERSION 2>/dev/null || echo "0.0.0")
if ! version_compatible "$AIDA_VERSION" ">=0.1.0"; then
    echo "Error: AIDA version $AIDA_VERSION incompatible. Requires >=0.1.0"
    exit 1
fi
source ~/.aida/lib/installer-common/*.sh
```

- Decision: Option B for robustness

### Assumptions to Validate

## AIDA Installation Location

- Assumption: AIDA always installs to `~/.aida/`
- Validation needed: Is this hardcoded or configurable?
- Impact: If configurable, dotfiles needs to detect location

## Shell Compatibility

- Assumption: Both installers use Bash 4.0+
- Validation needed: Do utilities work in zsh/dash/sh?
- Impact: May need POSIX-compatible alternatives

## File Permissions

- Assumption: Utilities are readable by dotfiles installer
- Validation needed: Are permissions set correctly by AIDA installer?
- Impact: May need explicit permission validation

## Dev Mode Behavior

- Assumption: Dev mode symlinks work for utility sourcing
- Validation needed: Does `source ~/.aida/lib/...` follow symlinks?
- Impact: Dev mode testing required

## 4. Recommendations

### High Priority

## 1. Extract Utilities from install.sh

Current `install.sh` has inline functions for:

- Color codes (lines 26-30)
- `print_message()` (lines 105-126)
- Platform detection (implicit in `validate_dependencies()`)
- Validation logic (lines 139-172)

Action: Extract these into `lib/installer-common/` files immediately

## 2. Define Version Compatibility Rules

Recommended semantic versioning approach:

- **Major version change**: Breaking changes (0.x → 1.x)
  - Dotfiles MUST match AIDA major version
  - Clear upgrade path required

- **Minor version change**: New features (0.1 → 0.2)
  - Forward compatible (AIDA 0.2 works with dotfiles 0.1)
  - Backward compatible (dotfiles 0.2 requires AIDA 0.2+)

- **Patch version change**: Bug fixes (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
  - Fully compatible in both directions

Document in: `docs/architecture/versioning.md`

## 3. Create version-check.sh Utility

```bash
# lib/installer-common/version-check.sh

compare_versions() {
    # Compare two semantic versions
    # Returns: 0 if equal, 1 if v1 > v2, 2 if v1 < v2
}

check_aida_compatibility() {
    # Check if AIDA version is compatible with requirements
    # Usage: check_aida_compatibility ">=0.1.0,<0.3.0"
}

get_aida_version() {
    # Read VERSION file, handle errors
}
```

## 4. Update install.sh to Use Shared Utilities

Refactor AIDA's `install.sh` to:

1. Define utilities in `lib/installer-common/`
2. Source utilities at script start
3. Dogfood: AIDA uses its own shared utilities
4. Proves utilities work before dotfiles depends on them

### Medium Priority

## 5. Document Integration Pattern

Create `docs/architecture/installer-integration.md`:

- How dotfiles sources AIDA utilities
- Version compatibility matrix
- Error handling patterns
- Example sourcing code
- Troubleshooting guide

## 6. Add Validation to AIDA Installer

Ensure AIDA installer:

- Sets correct permissions on `lib/installer-common/`
- Validates utilities are executable/readable
- Tests utility loading in dev mode
- Confirms VERSION file is readable

## 7. Create Integration Tests

Test scenarios:

1. Install AIDA → Install dotfiles (happy path)
2. Install dotfiles without AIDA (error path)
3. Install AIDA 0.1 → dotfiles requires 0.2 (version mismatch)
4. Dev mode AIDA → dotfiles sources utilities (symlink test)

### Low Priority

## 8. Consider Future Enhancements

- Auto-upgrade mechanism (dotfiles triggers AIDA upgrade)
- Version pinning in dotfiles (require exact AIDA version)
- Utility versioning (lib/installer-common versioned independently)
- Plugin system (third-party repos can also source utilities)

## 9. Add Telemetry/Logging

Track version compatibility issues:

- Log when version check fails
- Log which utilities are sourced
- Help debug integration issues
- Privacy-respecting (local logs only)

### What to Avoid

## Do NOT Create Circular Dependencies

- AIDA must remain standalone
- Dotfiles depends on AIDA (one-way only)
- Never make AIDA check for dotfiles

## Do NOT Overcomplicate VERSION File

- Keep it simple: single line, semantic version
- No JSON/YAML/TOML complexity
- Shell scripts must parse it easily
- Human-readable without tools

## Do NOT Break Standalone AIDA

- AIDA must work without dotfiles
- Utilities are for sharing, not required by AIDA
- AIDA can inline copies of utilities if needed
- Independence is critical

## Do NOT Ignore Dev Mode

- Test utility sourcing in dev mode (symlinks)
- Ensure relative paths work
- Dev workflow must not break
- Symlinks must be followed correctly

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (Critical - Do First)

1. Create `lib/installer-common/` directory structure
2. Extract utilities from `install.sh`:
   - `colors.sh` - color codes
   - `logging.sh` - print_message()
   - `validation.sh` - dependency checking
   - `platform-detect.sh` - OS detection

3. Refactor `install.sh` to source utilities
4. Test AIDA installation still works

### Phase 2: Version Management (Critical - Do Second)

1. Create `version-check.sh` utility
2. Define compatibility rules in documentation
3. Add version validation to utilities
4. Test version checking logic

### Phase 3: Integration Pattern (Important - Do Third)

1. Document sourcing pattern for dotfiles
2. Create example integration code
3. Write integration tests
4. Update architecture documentation

### Phase 4: Hardening (Nice to Have)

1. Add comprehensive error messages
2. Create troubleshooting guide
3. Add logging/telemetry
4. Plan future enhancements

## Success Criteria

- AIDA installer sources utilities from `lib/installer-common/`
- Dotfiles can source AIDA utilities successfully
- Version compatibility checking prevents broken states
- Clear error messages guide users to resolution
- Documentation explains integration pattern
- Tests validate all installation scenarios
- Dev mode works correctly with symlinks

## Notes

This configuration pattern establishes a template for future integrations. Any repository that wants to integrate with AIDA can follow the same pattern:

1. Check for `~/.aida/`
2. Read `~/.aida/VERSION`
3. Validate compatibility
4. Source utilities from `~/.aida/lib/installer-common/`
5. Proceed with integration

This makes AIDA extensible beyond just dotfiles.
