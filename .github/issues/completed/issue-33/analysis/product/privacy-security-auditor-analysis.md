# Privacy & Security Auditor Analysis: Issue #33

**Issue**: Support dotfiles installer integration - shared installer-common library and VERSION file
**Analyst**: Privacy & Security Auditor Agent
**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Priority**: CRITICAL (blocks dotfiles integration)

---

## 1. Domain-Specific Concerns

### Security Concerns

### **HIGH RISK: Untrusted Code Execution**

- Dotfiles installer sources shell scripts from `~/.aida/lib/installer-common/`
- NO integrity verification of sourced files before execution
- Attack: Replace `colors.sh` with malicious code → executes on next install
- Impact: Remote code execution, data exfiltration, privilege escalation

## Mitigation Required

- Checksum validation before sourcing (SHA256 hashes)
- File permission verification (must be 644, owned by user)
- Source path canonicalization (prevent symlink attacks)

### **HIGH RISK: VERSION File Tampering**

- VERSION file determines compatibility but lacks integrity checks
- No signature validation or checksum verification
- Attack: Modify VERSION to bypass compatibility checks
- Impact: Install incompatible versions, skip security updates

## Mitigation Required

- Git tag verification (signed tags preferred)
- Checksum validation against known-good values
- Reject if file permissions are world-writable

### **MEDIUM RISK: Command Injection in Validation**

```bash
# Vulnerable pattern in validation.sh
validate_input() {
    local input="$1"
    # VULNERABLE: No sanitization before use in command
    result=$(grep "$input" file.txt)
}
```

- User input passed to shell commands without sanitization
- Attack: Input like `"; rm -rf ~"` could execute commands
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution

## Mitigation Required

- Sanitize ALL input before use in commands
- Use `printf %q` or proper quoting
- Allowlist validation (strict regex patterns)

### **MEDIUM RISK: Path Traversal**

```bash
# Vulnerable pattern
source "${AIDA_PATH}/lib/installer-common/${filename}"
```

- If `filename` comes from user input: `../../etc/passwd`
- Attack: Source arbitrary files on system
- Impact: Information disclosure, code execution

## Mitigation Required

- Canonicalize all paths with `realpath`
- Validate paths stay within expected directories
- Reject paths containing `..` or absolute paths

### **MEDIUM RISK: Race Conditions (TOCTOU)**

```bash
# Vulnerable: Check then use
if [[ -f "$VERSION_FILE" ]]; then
    VERSION=$(cat "$VERSION_FILE")  # File could change here
fi
```

- Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use vulnerability
- Attack: Replace file between check and use
- Impact: Read malicious content, execution of wrong code

## Mitigation Required

- Atomic operations where possible
- Lock files during critical operations
- Validate after reading, not just before

### Privacy Concerns

### **MEDIUM RISK: Information Disclosure in Logs**

- Installer logs may contain sensitive information:
  - User home directory paths (reveals username)
  - System configuration details
  - Error messages with file paths

## Mitigation Required

- Scrub paths in log messages: `/Users/john/` → `~/`
- Generic error messages to users
- Detailed logs only to secure location (`~/.aida/logs/` with 600 perms)
- Never log environment variables

### **LOW RISK: VERSION File Privacy**

- VERSION file itself has no privacy concerns (version number only)
- However, version can reveal:
  - Unpatched vulnerabilities in older versions
  - Attack surface for version-specific exploits

## Mitigation

- Recommend users stay updated (security notice in install)
- Version checking should warn about outdated versions

### **LOW RISK: Installer-Common Library Metadata**

- Shared library files reveal framework architecture
- Not a privacy issue (public framework)
- Potential security issue: Information disclosure aids attackers

## Mitigation

- Minimize verbose error messages
- No internal paths or architecture details in public output

### Constraints & Requirements

### **MANDATORY: Public Framework Separation**

- This is the **public** repository (claude-personal-assistant)
- MUST NOT contain any private/user data
- MUST NOT access dotfiles-private secrets
- Installer-common library is PUBLIC → cannot have private logic

## Implications

- All security checks must work without private data
- No user-specific configurations in shared library
- Clean separation: AIDA (public) ← dotfiles (public) ← dotfiles-private

### **MANDATORY: Shell Security Standards**

All installer-common scripts MUST:

- Pass `shellcheck` with zero warnings
- Use `set -euo pipefail` for error handling
- Validate ALL user input before use
- Quote all variable expansions
- Use `readonly` for constants

### **MANDATORY: File Permissions**

Installer-common library files:

- Scripts: 755 (executable, not writable by others)
- Libraries: 644 (readable, not writable by others)
- Never 777 or world-writable
- Owned by installing user

## 2. Stakeholder Impact

### Who Is Affected?

#### **Primary: All Users (High Impact)**

- Every user running AIDA or dotfiles installers
- Affected by: Code execution vulnerabilities, privacy leaks
- Benefit: Shared utilities reduce code duplication, consistent UX

#### **Secondary: Dotfiles Users (Critical Impact)**

- Users installing dotfiles with AIDA integration
- Affected by: Version compatibility issues, broken installations
- Benefit: Seamless integration between AIDA and dotfiles

#### **Tertiary: Framework Maintainers (Medium Impact)**

- Developers maintaining AIDA and dotfiles
- Affected by: Security vulnerabilities requiring fixes
- Benefit: Single source of truth reduces maintenance burden

### Value Provided

## Positive

- **Consistency**: Single source of truth for installer utilities
- **Maintainability**: Update once, both installers benefit
- **Version Control**: Clear compatibility checking between repos
- **User Experience**: Consistent logging, colors, validation across installers

## Risks

- **Single Point of Failure**: Bug in shared library affects both installers
- **Security Amplification**: Vulnerability in shared code = 2x impact
- **Tight Coupling**: Dotfiles now depends on AIDA (acceptable, but requires careful versioning)

### Risks & Downsides

#### **Risk 1: Supply Chain Attack**

- Compromise GitHub repo → malicious installer-common library
- Dotfiles installer clones and executes malicious code
- Mitigation: Git tag signature verification, checksum validation

#### **Risk 2: Breaking Changes**

- Update installer-common library → breaks dotfiles installer
- Dotfiles specifies version range but library changes behavior
- Mitigation: Strict semantic versioning, compatibility testing

#### **Risk 3: Increased Attack Surface**

- More code = more bugs = more vulnerabilities
- Shared library must be hardened for both use cases
- Mitigation: Security-first implementation, comprehensive testing

## 3. Questions & Clarifications

### Missing Information

1. **Checksum Distribution**: How will installer-common checksums be distributed?
   - In VERSION file? (e.g., `0.1.0 <sha256>`)
   - Separate `CHECKSUMS.txt` file?
   - Git commit signatures?

2. **Error Handling**: How should shared library functions handle errors?
   - Return error codes?
   - Set global error variables?
   - Exit immediately?

3. **Logging Destination**: Where do shared library logs go?
   - To `~/.aida/logs/` even when called by dotfiles?
   - Caller-specified log location?
   - STDOUT/STDERR only?

4. **Platform Support**: Platform-detect.sh marked optional for v0.1
   - Does AIDA installer need it?
   - Should we implement for future-proofing?
   - Any platform-specific security concerns?

### Decisions Needed

1. **Security Level for v0.1.0**:
   - **Option A**: Basic validation only (faster, less secure)
   - **Option B**: Full security controls from audit (slower, secure)
   - **Recommendation**: Option B (security is not optional)

2. **Checksum Validation**:
   - **Option A**: Optional (users can skip with flag)
   - **Option B**: Mandatory (no way to skip)
   - **Recommendation**: Option B (mandatory for security)

3. **Error Verbosity**:
   - **Option A**: Verbose errors (helps debugging, info disclosure)
   - **Option B**: Generic errors (secure, frustrating for users)
   - **Recommendation**: Generic to users, verbose to log file (600 perms)

### Assumptions Needing Validation

1. **Assumption**: Dotfiles installer will only source from official AIDA repo
   - **Validate**: Can users specify alternative sources?
   - **Impact**: If yes, need user warning about untrusted sources

2. **Assumption**: `~/.aida/` is trusted after initial clone
   - **Validate**: Do we re-verify integrity on every source?
   - **Impact**: Performance vs. security tradeoff

3. **Assumption**: VERSION file format never changes (single line, semver)
   - **Validate**: What if we need metadata? (e.g., `0.1.0 <date> <hash>`)
   - **Impact**: Parsing logic must handle future formats

4. **Assumption**: Installer-common API is stable within minor versions
   - **Validate**: Can we change function signatures in patches? (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)
   - **Impact**: Dotfiles compatibility guarantees

## 4. Recommendations

### Approach Recommendation

## RECOMMENDED: Secure-First Implementation (Phase 1 + Phase 2)

## Phase 1 (MANDATORY for v0.1.0)

1. Implement all security validation functions (existing SECURITY_AUDIT.md)
2. Add checksum validation for VERSION file
3. Validate file permissions before sourcing
4. Sanitize all user input
5. Implement path canonicalization

## Phase 2 (RECOMMENDED for v0.1.0, MANDATORY for v0.2.0)

1. Git tag signature verification (signed tags)
2. Comprehensive integrity checking (all sourced files)
3. Secure logging with path scrubbing
4. TOCTOU mitigation (atomic operations)

## Rationale

- Security vulnerabilities = unacceptable risk
- Privacy leaks = framework trustworthiness
- Better to delay release than ship insecure code

### What Should Be Prioritized?

## Priority 1 (CRITICAL)

1. ✅ Input sanitization in validation.sh
2. ✅ Path canonicalization before sourcing
3. ✅ File permission checks before execution
4. ✅ VERSION file integrity validation

## Priority 2 (HIGH)

1. ⚠️ Secure logging (no PII, scrubbed paths)
2. ⚠️ Error handling (generic messages, detailed logs)
3. ⚠️ Checksum validation for installer-common files
4. ⚠️ TOCTOU mitigation

## Priority 3 (MEDIUM)

1. ⏰ Git tag signature verification
2. ⏰ Platform-detect.sh security hardening
3. ⏰ Automated security testing
4. ⏰ Fuzzing of validation functions

### What Should Be Avoided?

## AVOID: Shortcuts That Compromise Security

❌ **"We'll add security later"**

- Security is not a feature, it's a requirement
- Vulnerabilities in installer = complete system compromise
- No exceptions to security controls

❌ **"Trust the user's ~/.aida/ directory"**

- Local attackers can modify files
- Malware can tamper with installation
- ALWAYS validate before executing

❌ **"Checksum validation is optional"**

- Optional security = no security
- Users will disable it (convenience > security)
- Make it mandatory with clear UX

❌ **"Verbose error messages help users"**

- Information disclosure aids attackers
- Path disclosure reveals system structure
- Generic to user, detailed to secure log

❌ **"Shell scripts don't need security review"**

- Shell injection is trivial
- Installers run with user privileges
- Single mistake = complete compromise
