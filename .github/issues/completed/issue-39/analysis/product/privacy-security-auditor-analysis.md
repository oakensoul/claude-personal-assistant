# Privacy & Security Analysis: Workflow Command Templating

## 1. Domain-Specific Concerns

### Security Concerns

#### Command Execution Risk

- Commands execute complex workflows with git operations, GitHub API calls, and file system modifications
- Templating increases attack surface by allowing user customization of execution logic
- Users may inadvertently introduce command injection vulnerabilities in customized commands
- Malicious templates could be distributed that compromise user systems

#### File Permission Issues

- Commands create files in `~/.claude/commands/` after template copying
- Incorrect permissions on command files could allow unauthorized modification
- Dev mode uses symlinks which requires careful validation of link targets

#### Secret Exposure Risk

- Workflow commands interact with GitHub (require tokens/credentials)
- Commands may log sensitive information during git operations
- Template customization could accidentally hardcode secrets into command files
- Auto-commit functionality in `/implement` could commit sensitive data

### Privacy Concerns

#### Data Collection in Commands

- `/track-time` logs work activity and issue details
- `/implement` creates implementation summaries with project context
- `/start-work` captures issue requirements which may contain sensitive business information
- Commands create gitignored files but template errors could expose them

#### GitHub Integration Privacy

- Commands authenticate with GitHub using personal tokens
- `/open-pr` and `/start-work` interact with potentially private repositories
- Reviewer suggestions in `/open-pr` could leak internal team structure
- Issue assignments reveal individual work patterns

## 2. Stakeholder Impact

### Affected Parties

#### End Users (Primary)

- Value: Easy customization of workflow commands without modifying framework code
- Risk: May introduce security vulnerabilities through improper customization
- Risk: May accidentally expose sensitive data in customized templates

#### Framework Maintainers

- Value: Clean separation of user-customizable vs framework-maintained code
- Risk: Harder to enforce security best practices in user-modified templates
- Risk: Support burden increases with custom template debugging

#### Enterprise Users

- Value: Can standardize team workflows through custom command templates
- Risk: Organizational secrets could leak through poorly customized commands
- Risk: Compliance violations if commands don't properly handle sensitive data

### Value Proposition

#### Customization Benefits

- Users can adapt commands to their specific workflow needs
- Teams can standardize on shared command templates
- Easier to extend framework without forking core code
- Templates serve as documentation of intended behavior

#### Security Trade-offs

- Increased attack surface through user customization
- Harder to audit security when templates are modified
- Users may not understand security implications of changes
- Template validation becomes critical but challenging

## 3. Questions & Clarifications

### Missing Information

#### Template Validation

- Will there be validation of customized command templates before execution?
- Should templates undergo security linting or static analysis?
- How will users be warned about security risks in customization?

#### Template Distribution

- Can users share custom command templates with others?
- Will there be a template marketplace or sharing mechanism?
- How will malicious templates be prevented from spreading?

#### Versioning & Updates

- How will framework updates handle user-customized templates?
- Will there be a way to diff user changes vs framework defaults?
- Should users be notified when framework templates change?

#### Permissions & Sandboxing

- What file permissions should template files have?
- Should commands run in a sandboxed environment?
- Are there limits on what operations commands can perform?

### Decisions Needed

#### Security Model

- Decision: Will commands have restricted capabilities or full shell access?
- Decision: Should commands require explicit user approval for sensitive operations?
- Decision: Will there be a command signing/verification mechanism?

#### Customization Scope

- Decision: Which parts of commands should be user-customizable?
- Decision: Should there be "safe zones" that can't be modified?
- Decision: Will there be different template trust levels (framework vs user vs third-party)?

#### Privacy Controls

- Decision: How will commands handle PII and sensitive data logging?
- Decision: Should commands scrub output before writing to files?
- Decision: Will there be opt-in/opt-out for data collection in commands?

### Assumptions to Validate

#### Assumption: Users understand security implications

- Validation needed: Do users know the risks of customizing command templates?
- Mitigation: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation

#### Assumption: Template files are trusted

- Validation needed: Can template files be verified for integrity?
- Mitigation: Implement checksums or signing for framework templates

#### Assumption: Commands won't be used maliciously

- Validation needed: Are there sufficient safeguards against abuse?
- Mitigation: Add sandboxing, approval prompts, and audit logging

## 4. Recommendations

### Priority 1: Security Safeguards

#### Template Validation Framework

- Implement pre-execution validation of command templates
- Check for common security anti-patterns (command injection, path traversal)
- Warn users when templates contain potentially dangerous operations
- Provide shellcheck-style linting for command template markdown

#### Secure Defaults

- Set restrictive file permissions on template files (644 for templates, 600 for generated commands)
- Validate symlink targets in dev mode to prevent directory traversal
- Sanitize all user input before use in shell commands
- Never allow templates to bypass git hooks or security checks

#### Secret Management

- Document that secrets must NEVER be hardcoded in command templates
- Provide examples of proper secret handling (environment variables, keychain)
- Add automated scanning for common secret patterns in templates
- Warn when commands attempt to log potentially sensitive information

### Priority 2: Privacy Protection

#### Data Minimization in Commands

- Review each command for unnecessary data collection
- Ensure `/track-time` doesn't log sensitive issue details
- Validate `/implement` doesn't include PII in summaries
- Confirm gitignore patterns prevent exposure of command output

#### Scrubbing Requirements

- Commands that write to files should scrub PII before writing
- Git commit messages should be reviewed for sensitive data
- Log output should be sanitized before persisting
- Consider implementing structured logging with PII redaction

#### Privacy Documentation

- Document what data each command collects and why
- Provide users with opt-out mechanisms for data collection
- Explain how command output is stored and shared
- Clarify GitHub integration privacy implications

### Priority 3: User Safety

#### Security Guidelines

- Create comprehensive guide for safe template customization
- Document common security pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Provide secure template examples for each command
- Include security checklist for reviewing customized templates

#### Progressive Disclosure

- Start with safe, limited customization options
- Provide advanced customization only with explicit opt-in
- Show warnings when users modify security-sensitive sections
- Consider template "difficulty levels" (beginner/intermediate/advanced)

#### Validation & Testing

- Implement dry-run mode for testing customized commands
- Provide command validation utility (`aida validate-command`)
- Add integration tests for security-sensitive command behaviors
- Create test suite for template validation logic

### What to Prioritize

#### Immediate Actions

1. Add template validation before copying to `~/.claude/commands/`
2. Set secure file permissions on all template files
3. Document security best practices for template customization
4. Review existing commands for secret exposure risks

#### Short-Term Actions

1. Implement shellcheck-style validation for command templates
2. Add warning prompts for sensitive operations (git push, GitHub API calls)
3. Create security guidelines documentation
4. Audit all four commands for PII/secret handling

#### Long-Term Considerations

1. Consider sandboxing or capability-based security model
2. Implement command signing for framework-distributed templates
3. Create template marketplace with security review process
4. Add audit logging for command execution

### What to Avoid

#### Anti-Patterns to Prevent

- Do NOT allow templates to disable security features (hooks, validation)
- Do NOT trust user-customized templates without validation
- Do NOT log sensitive data without explicit user consent
- Do NOT allow templates to access files outside `~/.claude/` or `~/.aida/`

#### Design Pitfalls

- Avoid making customization too complex (increases error risk)
- Avoid silent failures in validation (warn users explicitly)
- Avoid storing secrets in template files or examples
- Avoid creating templates that bypass privacy controls

#### Common Vulnerabilities

- Command injection through unsanitized user input
- Path traversal through unvalidated file paths
- Secret exposure through verbose logging or error messages
- Information disclosure through overly detailed command output

## Summary

Moving workflow commands to templates provides valuable customization capabilities but introduces significant security and privacy risks. The primary concerns are:

### Security Risks

- User customization can introduce command injection and other vulnerabilities
- Template distribution could spread malicious code
- File permissions and symlink handling require careful validation

### Privacy Risks

- Commands interact with sensitive data (GitHub, git, work logs)
- Customization could bypass privacy controls
- Data collection in commands needs clear documentation and controls

### Recommended Approach

- Implement robust template validation before execution
- Set secure defaults for permissions and secret handling
- Provide comprehensive security documentation
- Start with limited customization and expand progressively
- Add validation utilities and dry-run testing

### Critical Success Factors

- Template validation must be non-bypassable
- Security warnings must be clear and actionable
- Documentation must educate users on risks
- Privacy controls must be enforced across all commands

With proper safeguards, templating workflow commands can enhance AIDA's flexibility while maintaining security and privacy standards.
