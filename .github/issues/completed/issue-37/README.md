# Issue #37: Archive global agents and commands to templates folder

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Labels**: type:task
**Milestone**: 0.1.0 - Foundation
**Assignees**: oakensoul

## Description

Dump all existing "global" agents and commands from ~/.claude/ into the templates/ folder to create a committed record as we move forward with development.

Questions to address:

- Should these be added as .template files with variable substitution?
- Do we need to include their knowledge/ subdirectories?
- What's the proper structure for archiving these resources?

This will preserve the current state of agents and commands for reference and potential future template use.

## Expert Consultation Results

Consulted with `claude-agent-manager` agent for guidance on proper archival structure.

### Key Recommendations

1. **Archive EVERYTHING** from ~/.claude/ (all commands and agents)
2. **Include knowledge directories** with full hierarchy
3. **Use exact copies** (not .template) for most files - only use .template when actual variable substitution is needed
4. **Commands need path substitution** using ${PROJECT_ROOT} pattern for portability
5. **Preserve structure** that mirrors what users will have in ~/.claude/

### Recommended Structure

```text
templates/
├── README.md                          # Documentation for templates
├── agents/
│   ├── README.md                      # Agent templates documentation
│   ├── {agent-with-knowledge}/        # Subdirectory for agents with knowledge
│   │   ├── {agent-name}.md
│   │   └── knowledge/                 # Complete knowledge tree
│   │       ├── index.md
│   │       ├── core-concepts/
│   │       ├── patterns/
│   │       └── decisions/
│   └── {simple-agent}.md              # Simple agents without knowledge
│
├── commands/
│   ├── README.md                      # Command templates documentation
│   └── {command-name}.md              # All commands at root level
│
└── documents/                         # Existing document templates
    ├── PRD.md.template
    └── TECH_SPEC.md.template
```

## Requirements

### Commands to Archive (14 total)

From ~/.claude/commands/:

- cleanup-main.md
- create-agent.md
- create-command.md
- create-issue.md
- expert-analysis.md
- generate-docs.md
- implement.md
- open-pr.md
- publish-issue.md
- start-work.md
- track-time.md
- workflow-init.md

**Note**: Commands contain project-specific paths that need variable substitution:

- Replace `/Users/oakensoul/Developer/oakensoul/claude-personal-assistant` with `${PROJECT_ROOT}`
- Replace other absolute paths with appropriate variables

### Agents to Archive

From ~/.claude/agents/:

**Core agents** (with knowledge directories):

- claude-agent-manager
- code-reviewer
- devops-engineer
- product-manager
- tech-lead
- technical-writer

**Specialized agents** (check for knowledge directories):

- api-design-architect
- claude-code-manager
- larp-data-architect
- larp-product-manager
- larp-qa-engineer
- mysql-data-engineer
- nextjs-engineer
- performance-auditor
- php-engineer
- strapi-backend-engineer
- web-frontend-engineer
- web-security-architect

### Variable Substitution Pattern

For commands with hardcoded paths:

```bash
# Original
cat /Users/oakensoul/Developer/oakensoul/claude-personal-assistant/.claude/workflow-state.json

# Template version
cat ${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/workflow-state.json
```

**Variables to define**:

- `${PROJECT_ROOT}` - Current working directory for project-specific commands
- `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}` - Typically ~/.claude for user config
- `${AIDA_HOME}` - Typically ~/.aida for AIDA installation

## Technical Details

### Implementation Steps

1. **Prepare templates/ structure**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p templates/commands
   mkdir -p templates/agents
   ```

2. **Archive commands** (with path substitution):

   ```bash
   for cmd in ~/.claude/commands/*.md; do
     name=$(basename "$cmd")
     sed 's|/Users/oakensoul/Developer/oakensoul/claude-personal-assistant|${PROJECT_ROOT}|g' \
         "$cmd" > "templates/commands/$name"
   done
   ```

3. **Archive agents with knowledge**:

   ```bash
   for agent_dir in ~/.claude/agents/*/; do
     agent_name=$(basename "$agent_dir")

     # Check if knowledge directory exists
     if [ -d "$agent_dir/knowledge" ]; then
       mkdir -p "templates/agents/$agent_name"

       # Copy agent file
       cp ~/.claude/agents/$agent_name.md "templates/agents/$agent_name/"

       # Copy entire knowledge tree
       cp -r "$agent_dir/knowledge" "templates/agents/$agent_name/"
     fi
   done
   ```

4. **Archive simple agents** (without knowledge):

   ```bash
   for agent in ~/.claude/agents/*.md; do
     name=$(basename "$agent")
     agent_name="${name%.md}"

     # Skip if knowledge directory exists (already handled)
     if [ ! -d ~/.claude/agents/$agent_name ]; then
       cp "$agent" "templates/agents/"
     fi
   done
   ```

5. **Create documentation**:
   - templates/README.md - Overall templates documentation
   - templates/agents/README.md - Agent templates guide
   - templates/commands/README.md - Command templates guide

### Future Installation Flow

Once archived, install.sh can install templates:

```bash
# Copy all agent templates
cp -r templates/agents/* ~/.claude/agents/

# Install commands with variable substitution
for cmd in templates/commands/*.md; do
  sed -e "s|\${PROJECT_ROOT}|$(pwd)|g" \
      "$cmd" > ~/.claude/commands/$(basename "$cmd")
done
```

## Success Criteria

## Resolution

**Completed**: 2025-10-07
**Pull Request**: #38

### Changes Made

Successfully archived Phase 1 of agents and commands to version-controlled templates with comprehensive privacy validation infrastructure:

**Template System**:

- Archived 8 core commands to `templates/commands/` with runtime variable substitution
- Archived 6 core agents to `templates/agents/` with knowledge structures
- Created knowledge directories with privacy-safe placeholders (core-concepts/, patterns/, decisions/)
- All hardcoded paths replaced with `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}`, `${PROJECT_ROOT}`, `${AIDA_HOME}`

**Privacy Validation Infrastructure**:

- Created `scripts/validate-templates.sh` - comprehensive privacy validation script
- Added pre-commit hook for automated template privacy checking
- Detects hardcoded paths, usernames, credentials, email addresses
- CI/CD integration with proper exit codes

**Documentation**:

- `templates/README.md` (16KB) - Template system overview, runtime variables, installation flow
- `templates/commands/README.md` (15KB) - All 8 commands documented with examples
- `templates/agents/README.md` (25KB) - All 6 agents, two-tier knowledge system explained
- `scripts/README.md` (4.8KB) - Privacy validation script usage

### Implementation Details

**Runtime Variable Resolution** (Q3 Decision):

- Templates use `${VAR}` syntax resolved by Claude at runtime
- No .template extensions needed - Claude resolves intelligently
- Simplified architecture compared to install-time processing

**Privacy-Safe Templates**:

- All templates pass comprehensive privacy validation
- No usernames, hardcoded paths, or personal data
- Knowledge directories contain generic placeholders only

**Quality Assurance**:

- All markdown files pass linting (MD031, MD040, MD022, MD032, MD007)
- Shellcheck passes with zero warnings
- All pre-commit hooks pass (12 checks including new privacy validation)
- Manual privacy review completed

**Version Control**:

- 7 commits total (6 feature commits + 1 workflow state)
- Conventional commit format throughout
- Clean git history with logical atomic commits

### Notes

**Phase 1 Complete**: Archived 8 core commands + 6 core agents

**Phase 2 Deferred**: 16 specialized agents to be addressed in future issue:

- Specialist agents (php-engineer, nextjs-engineer, strapi-backend-engineer, etc.)
- LARP-specific agents (larp-product-manager, larp-qa-engineer, larp-data-architect)
- Architecture agents (api-design-architect, web-security-architect, performance-auditor, etc.)

**Effort Analysis**:

- Estimated: 1 hour
- Actual: 4.5 hours
- Variance: +350% (complexity underestimated)
- Primary time sinks:
  - Markdown linting fixes for all archived files (100+ violations)
  - Privacy validation script development and testing
  - Comprehensive documentation writing (56KB total)
  - Manual privacy review and validation

**Key Learnings**:

- Archiving existing files requires significant cleanup (linting, privacy)
- Documentation is time-consuming but essential
- Runtime variable resolution (Q3 decision) simplified architecture significantly
- Privacy validation infrastructure will save time in Phase 2
