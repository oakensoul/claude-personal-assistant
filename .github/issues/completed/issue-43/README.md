# Issue #43: Sync user Claude configuration changes back to repository templates

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Labels**:
**Milestone**: 0.1.0
**Assignees**: splash-rob

## Description

Recent work has resulted in substantial additions and modifications to the local `~/.claude/agents/` and `~/.claude/commands/` directories that need to be evaluated and potentially merged back into the repository's `templates/` directory.

### Current State Analysis

**User Configuration (`~/.claude/`)**:

- **Agents**: 15 total
  - In templates: claude-agent-manager, code-reviewer, devops-engineer, product-manager, tech-lead, technical-writer
  - **New/Modified**: cost-optimization-agent, data-governance-agent, security-engineer, knowledge (possibly custom)

- **Commands**: 27 total
  - In templates: cleanup-main, create-agent, create-command, create-issue, expert-analysis, generate-docs, implement, open-pr, publish-issue, start-work, track-time, workflow-init
  - **New/Modified**: compliance-check, cost-review, debug, github-init, github-sync, incident, metric-audit, optimize-warehouse, pii-scan, plus several others

**Repository Templates**:

- **Agents**: 7 total (6 agent folders + README)
- **Commands**: 15 total (14 command files + README)

## Requirements

1. **Comparison & Analysis**:
   - Compare each user agent/command against repository templates
   - Identify which are new vs. modified vs. identical
   - Determine which changes should be promoted to templates
   - Document any user-specific customizations that should remain local

2. **Template Updates**:
   - Add new agents to `templates/agents/` (cost-optimization, data-governance, security-engineer)
   - Add new commands to `templates/commands/` (compliance-check, cost-review, debug, github-init, github-sync, incident, metric-audit, optimize-warehouse, pii-scan, etc.)
   - Update modified templates with improvements
   - Update README files in both directories

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document new agents and commands in relevant docs
   - Update installation script if needed
   - Add any new dependencies or requirements

4. **Testing**:
   - Verify new templates work correctly
   - Test installation with new templates
   - Ensure no breaking changes

## Technical Details

**Files to Review**:

- `~/.claude/agents/` vs `templates/agents/`
- `~/.claude/commands/` vs `templates/commands/`
- Installation script (`install.sh`) for any new requirements

**New Agents to Add**:

- cost-optimization-agent
- data-governance-agent
- security-engineer
- Review: knowledge (determine if template-worthy)

**New Commands to Add**:

- compliance-check.md
- cost-review.md
- debug.md
- github-init.md
- github-sync.md
- incident.md
- metric-audit.md
- optimize-warehouse.md
- pii-scan.md
- runbook.md (if exists)
- security-audit.md (if exists)
- sla-report.md (if exists)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All new agents from `~/.claude/agents/` are evaluated and appropriate ones added to `templates/agents/`
- [ ] All new commands from `~/.claude/commands/` are evaluated and appropriate ones added to `templates/commands/`
- [ ] Modified templates are updated with improvements
- [ ] README files in `templates/agents/` and `templates/commands/` are updated
- [ ] Documentation reflects new agents and commands
- [ ] Installation process works with new templates
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks pass (markdown, shell, YAML linting)
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced

## Investigation Steps

1. Use `diff` or comparison tool to identify differences
2. Review each new file for quality and reusability
3. Check for any sensitive/personal information that shouldn't be in templates
4. Ensure consistent formatting and documentation standards

## Resolution

**Completed**: 2025-10-18
**Pull Request**: #51 - <https://github.com/oakensoul/claude-personal-assistant/pull/51>

### Changes Made

**Phase 1** (2025-10-10): Initial Template Sync

1. **Agent Reorganization**: Implemented two-tier agent architecture
   - Moved 6 project agents to `.claude/project/context/` with project-specific context
   - Converted product-manager and tech-lead to two-tier structure
   - Added AIDA framework agents to global templates

2. **New Agent Templates** (11 agents):
   - aws-cloud-engineer, datadog-observability-engineer, cost-optimization-agent
   - data-governance-agent, security-engineer, configuration-specialist
   - integration-specialist, privacy-security-auditor, qa-engineer
   - shell-script-specialist, shell-systems-ux-designer

3. **New Command Templates** (23 commands):
   - Quality: code-review, script-audit, config-validate, ux-review, qa-check, test-plan
   - Security: security-audit, compliance-check, pii-scan
   - Operations: incident, debug, runbook
   - Infrastructure: aws-review, github-init, github-sync
   - Data: metric-audit, optimize-warehouse, cost-review, sla-report

**Phase 2** (2025-10-18): Architecture Foundation & Command Structure Refactoring

4. **ADR-010: Command Structure Refactoring** - Complete redesign of 70 commands:
   - Workflow-oriented naming (issue/repository/ssh prefixes, not technology names)
   - Noun-verb convention (/agent-create not /create-agent)
   - 13-step issue workflow with trust-building granularity
   - 11 repository management commands (VCS-agnostic: GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)
   - 6 SSH key management commands with security-first design
   - Progress management: checkpoint, pause, resume workflows
   - Automation modes: autopilot (professional), yolo (fun) for high-trust scenarios

5. **Architecture Decision Records** (5 ADRs):
   - ADR-002: Two-Tier Agent Architecture (global vs project-specific)
   - ADR-006: Analyst/Engineer Agent Pattern (separation of concerns)
   - ADR-007: Product/Platform/API Engineering Model (team structure alignment)
   - ADR-008: Engineers Own Testing Philosophy (no separate QA team)
   - ADR-009: Skills System Architecture (knowledge management framework)

6. **Skills System** - 177 reusable knowledge modules across 28 categories:
   - Testing: pytest, jest, rspec, playwright, cypress patterns
   - Infrastructure: terraform, kubernetes, docker, observability
   - Data: dbt, airflow, data-quality, dimensional-modeling
   - Cloud: aws-services, gcp-services, azure-services
   - Security: encryption, access-control, threat-modeling
   - Compliance: GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC2
   - Analytics: metabase, looker, tableau, powerbi
   - Business: saas-metrics, product-metrics, financial-metrics
   - 20 additional categories

7. **New Agent Templates** (4 additional agents):
   - data-engineer: Data pipeline orchestration, dbt, ELT, data quality
   - metabase-engineer: BI platform, YAML specs, API operations, visualization
   - sql-expert: Query optimization, platform-specific best practices (Snowflake focus)
   - system-architect: Architecture patterns, ADRs, C4 models, system design

8. **VCS Provider Configuration System**:
   - Auto-detection from git remote (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)
   - Quick setup modes: /aida-init [provider] (github|gitlab|bitbucket|--minimal)
   - Configuration hierarchy (project > user)
   - Support for any VCS/work tracker combination

9. **Architecture Documentation**:
   - C4 system context diagram for AIDA framework
   - Agent interaction patterns and coordination workflows
   - Agent migration plan for new structure
   - Skills catalog with complete 177-skill reference
   - Skills guide for using knowledge modules

10. **Command Reorganization** (per ADR-008):
    - Removed specialist commands: config-validate, integration-check, qa-check, ux-review
    - Validation now part of analyst workflows (engineers own quality)
    - Added install-agent command for global template installation

### Implementation Details

**Phase 1 Details**:

- Two-tier architecture separates global agent definitions from project-specific context
- All templates maintain privacy by using variable substitution ({{VAR}})
- New agents include comprehensive knowledge bases with core concepts, patterns, and reference materials
- Command templates follow consistent structure with frontmatter, usage examples, and workflow steps

**Phase 2 Details**:

- **"Granularity builds trust"** architectural principle: Command structure designed for AI adoption through baby steps
- Each command is a trust checkpoint where developers verify, iterate, and build confidence
- Workflow-oriented naming: Commands reflect what you're doing (issue workflow), not what tool you're using (GitHub)
- Dopamine gamification: Multiple checkpoints provide frequent reward moments vs one long automation
- /issue-autopilot and /issue-yolo: Same command, different personalities (professional vs fun)
- SSH key management addresses pain points: tracking which keys are used where, rotation, security audits
- Skills system provides reusable knowledge that agents can reference (no duplication across agent knowledge bases)
- VCS provider abstraction allows commands to work with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket seamlessly

### Notes

**Phase 1** (2025-10-10):

- Actual effort: 4 hours (double the 2-hour estimate) due to extensive agent knowledge base creation
- Command consolidation will be implemented in v0.1.0 milestone
- Two-tier architecture provides better separation of concerns for cross-project agents

**Phase 2** (2025-10-18):

- Additional effort: 7 hours for command structure refactoring design session
- Total actual effort: 11 hours (5.5x the original 2-hour estimate)
- Scope expansion justified by foundational architecture work:
  - 5 ADRs establish decision record practices
  - Skills system enables knowledge reuse across all agents
  - Command structure refactoring provides roadmap for next 10 weeks of implementation
  - VCS provider abstraction enables multi-platform support
- **Key insight**: This wasn't just "sync templates" - it became **"design the foundation of AIDA's architecture"**
- Work completed in two phases:
  - Phase 1: Template synchronization (what we planned)
  - Phase 2: Architecture foundation (emergent requirement from Phase 1 discoveries)
