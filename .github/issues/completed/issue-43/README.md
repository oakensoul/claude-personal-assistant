# Issue #43: Sync user Claude configuration changes back to repository templates

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Labels**:
**Milestone**: 0.1.0
**Assignees**: splash-rob

## Description

Recent work has resulted in substantial additions and modifications to the local `~/.claude/agents/` and `~/.claude/commands/` directories that need to be evaluated and potentially merged back into the repository's `templates/` directory.

### Current State Analysis

**User Configuration (`~/.claude/`)**:
- **Agents**: 15 total
  - In templates: claude-agent-manager, code-reviewer, devops-engineer, product-manager, tech-lead, technical-writer
  - **New/Modified**: cost-optimization-agent, data-governance-agent, security-engineer, knowledge (possibly custom)

- **Commands**: 27 total
  - In templates: cleanup-main, create-agent, create-command, create-issue, expert-analysis, generate-docs, implement, open-pr, publish-issue, start-work, track-time, workflow-init
  - **New/Modified**: compliance-check, cost-review, debug, github-init, github-sync, incident, metric-audit, optimize-warehouse, pii-scan, plus several others

**Repository Templates**:
- **Agents**: 7 total (6 agent folders + README)
- **Commands**: 15 total (14 command files + README)

## Requirements

1. **Comparison & Analysis**:
   - Compare each user agent/command against repository templates
   - Identify which are new vs. modified vs. identical
   - Determine which changes should be promoted to templates
   - Document any user-specific customizations that should remain local

2. **Template Updates**:
   - Add new agents to `templates/agents/` (cost-optimization, data-governance, security-engineer)
   - Add new commands to `templates/commands/` (compliance-check, cost-review, debug, github-init, github-sync, incident, metric-audit, optimize-warehouse, pii-scan, etc.)
   - Update modified templates with improvements
   - Update README files in both directories

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document new agents and commands in relevant docs
   - Update installation script if needed
   - Add any new dependencies or requirements

4. **Testing**:
   - Verify new templates work correctly
   - Test installation with new templates
   - Ensure no breaking changes

## Technical Details

**Files to Review**:
- `~/.claude/agents/` vs `templates/agents/`
- `~/.claude/commands/` vs `templates/commands/`
- Installation script (`install.sh`) for any new requirements

**New Agents to Add**:
- cost-optimization-agent
- data-governance-agent
- security-engineer
- Review: knowledge (determine if template-worthy)

**New Commands to Add**:
- compliance-check.md
- cost-review.md
- debug.md
- github-init.md
- github-sync.md
- incident.md
- metric-audit.md
- optimize-warehouse.md
- pii-scan.md
- runbook.md (if exists)
- security-audit.md (if exists)
- sla-report.md (if exists)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All new agents from `~/.claude/agents/` are evaluated and appropriate ones added to `templates/agents/`
- [ ] All new commands from `~/.claude/commands/` are evaluated and appropriate ones added to `templates/commands/`
- [ ] Modified templates are updated with improvements
- [ ] README files in `templates/agents/` and `templates/commands/` are updated
- [ ] Documentation reflects new agents and commands
- [ ] Installation process works with new templates
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks pass (markdown, shell, YAML linting)
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced

## Investigation Steps

1. Use `diff` or comparison tool to identify differences
2. Review each new file for quality and reusability
3. Check for any sensitive/personal information that shouldn't be in templates
4. Ensure consistent formatting and documentation standards

## Notes

## Resolution

**Completed**: 2025-10-10
**Pull Request**: #51 - https://github.com/oakensoul/claude-personal-assistant/pull/51

### Changes Made

1. **Agent Reorganization**: Implemented two-tier agent architecture
   - Moved 6 project agents to `.claude/agents-global/` with project-specific context
   - Converted product-manager and tech-lead to two-tier structure
   - Added AIDA framework agents to global templates

2. **New Agent Templates** (11 agents):
   - aws-cloud-engineer: AWS service expertise and CDK patterns
   - datadog-observability-engineer: Monitoring and observability
   - cost-optimization-agent: Snowflake cost analysis
   - data-governance-agent: Data compliance and privacy
   - security-engineer: Security and threat modeling
   - configuration-specialist, integration-specialist, privacy-security-auditor, qa-engineer, shell-script-specialist, shell-systems-ux-designer

3. **New Command Templates** (23 commands):
   - Quality assurance: code-review, script-audit, config-validate, ux-review, qa-check, test-plan
   - Security & compliance: security-audit, compliance-check, pii-scan
   - Operations: incident, debug, runbook
   - Infrastructure: aws-review, github-init, github-sync
   - Data & analytics: metric-audit, optimize-warehouse, cost-review, sla-report

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated templates/commands/README.md to document all 32 commands
   - Added categorization and v0.1.0 consolidation plan notes
   - Created .claude/agents-global/README.md explaining two-tier architecture

5. **Milestone Planning**:
   - Created and published 7 v0.1.0 milestone issues (#44-#50)
   - Defined command consolidation plan: 32 â†’ 10 command groups
   - Archived published issues to .github/issues/published/v0.1/

### Implementation Details

- Two-tier architecture separates global agent definitions from project-specific context
- All templates maintain privacy by using variable substitution ({{VAR}})
- New agents include comprehensive knowledge bases with core concepts, patterns, and reference materials
- Command templates follow consistent structure with frontmatter, usage examples, and workflow steps

### Notes

- Actual effort was 4 hours (double the estimate) due to extensive agent knowledge base creation
- Command consolidation will be implemented in v0.1.0 milestone
- Two-tier architecture provides better separation of concerns for cross-project agents
