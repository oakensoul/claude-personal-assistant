# Create migration system and comprehensive v0.1 documentation

## Problem

As we launch v0.1.0 with the new consolidated command structure:

- Need clear documentation for all new commands
- Need migration guide for any early adopters
- Need comprehensive examples for all workflows
- Need testing documentation
- Need contribution guidelines updates

## Solution

Create comprehensive documentation suite and migration system for v0.1.0 launch.

## Dependencies

Depends on all other v0.1.0 issues being completed:

- versioning-system (#1)
- work-command (#2)
- workflow-commands (#3)
- operations-commands (#4)
- quality-commands (#5)
- aida-command (#6)

This is the final issue to complete before v0.1.0 release.

## Documentation Standards

- All examples must be tested
- All code blocks must have language specifiers
- All commands must have clear descriptions
- All workflows must have complete examples
- All troubleshooting steps must be verified
- All links must be valid

## Notes

- This is the final step before v0.1.0 release
- Documentation quality is critical for adoption
- Migration guide must be clear for early adopters
- Examples must cover all flexibility scenarios
- Comprehensive troubleshooting prevents support burden
- Good documentation enables community contributions
